2,Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'The iPhone 8 reminds me of the fifth Transformers movie??you know it's new, though you can't for the life of you figure out how it's different. On its face, the 8 looks like an iPhone from 2014. And like another sequel, the best thing about the iPhone 8 is that it's entirely avoidable. Normally, iPhone owners have one decision to make: Is it an upgrade year or not? But this fall, you have real options. Apple's selling the $700 iPhone 8, the jumbo $800 iPhone 8 Plus and the totally redesigned $1,000 iPhone X, not to mention five older (and cheaper) iPhones. If you follow the Goldilocks Principle, an iPhone 8 might seem like a sensible choice. It has a new camera and processor, yet doesn't cost quite as much as the fancy-pants X. But let's stop taking electronics advice from a girl who robs bears. Putting the iPhone 8 through its paces for the past week, I learned Apple should have called it the iPhone 7s. (The company skipped the """" model this year, calling it a ""new generation."") The iPhone 8 is a good smartphone, but only a slight improvement, mostly in the camera department. Let me propose a different iPhone purchasing strategy: * If you need to have the latest and greatest, don't buy the 8. Wait until we get a closer look at the iPhone X, which in addition to face-scanning tricks promises two things that really matter: a bigger, better screen and two more hours of battery life. * If you can't be bothered with bells and whistles, you can save a chunk of cheese by buying a nearly-as-good iPhone 7 (albeit with less storage) for $550. Or you can save even more by getting one of the Android phones that no longer lag behind Apple in refinement, like the $480 OnePlus 5. Because of Apple's staggered rollout, I haven't had opportunity to test the iPhone X. But for anyone considering buying an iPhone 8, here is how it measures against a trusty iPhone 7. Glass Back From the front, it's harder to tell the difference between the 7 and 8 than to ID an Olsen twin. But look on the back, and you will see it's made of glass rather than metal. The glass might remind you of the iPhone 4, one of the most iconic Apple designs. But I'm not sold. The iPhone 7's glossy black finish gives it a contiguous surface, like a pebble smoothed by the ocean. The iPhone 8 shows seams where the glass touches the aluminum band, making it feel a little like a knockoff. And there's no denying it looks dated compared with the curved glass on rival Samsung's Galaxy S8 ($720), which takes the screen all the way to the edge. Apple says it is the hardest glass it has ever put in an iPhone, but I still worry about cracking. I have accidentally dropped the 8 on wood twice without problem. Fingers crossed! (Even with the extra risk, it still doesn't make economic sense to buy an AppleCare Plus extended warranty.) Wireless Charging There is a practical reason for the glass: It enables the 8's standout new capability, wireless charging. No, you can't beam power to it from across the room. You have to place it on a Qi-compatible charging pad, sold separately for $40 and up. It works??just OK. While convenient, it isn't fast. The $60 Mophie brand pad I tested required me to put the phone in just the right spot. One time, I plopped it down and later found my battery almost depleted because the phone was sitting slightly off-center. Apple's working on improving that with a new design, but it won't arrive until next year. I have long criticized Apple for not embracing wireless charging. Hopefully, now that it has, the tech will become more widely available. Another new option is ""ast charging,"" which powers up the phone 50% in 30 minutes. The catch is, to do it, Apple recommends its 29W USB-C charger ($50) and a USB-C-to-Lightning cable ($25). How about battery life? Apple claims there is no improvement. In my stress tests versus the iPhone 7, I squeezed about 15 more minutes out of the 8_x0014_for a total of 10 and three quarters hours. The 8 Plus lasted about 11 hours. I'll take every battery improvement I can get, but none of this will rock your world. New Cameras Perhaps you spotted me last weekend running around San Francisco taking the same photo on four different phones: the dual-camera 8 Plus, 7 Plus and Samsung Note 8 as well as Google's older single-camera Pixel XL. Some 1,500 shots later, I preferred most of the ones from the rear iPhone 8 Plus camera, which is similar (though not exactly the same) to the one on the iPhone X. A larger, faster, sensor and new processing helps the iPhone 8 capture more saturation and contrast_x0014_sunsets are less hazy and faces look sharper. In low-light situations, it retains more detail than the Note 8. It was as if all the shots had been given a boost in Instagram. And while I have avoided using the flash on past iPhones, the 8's was smart enough to actually improve my shots. But you will have to look closely. There has been no resolution change_x0014_still 12 megapixels. And I didn't find any shocking improvements like I saw in low-light performance we got in the iPhone 7. (See additional example shots of Steve Jobs Theater, a cable car, a mural in bright sun and a flash in a dim room.) The one trick that you can only get on the 8 Plus is a new Portrait Lighting mode, where the phone's second camera collects depth data used to create dramatic effects. I don't find it as useful as the Portrait mode that artfully blurs out backgrounds??and is already available on the iPhone 7 Plus. Faster Processor I'll spare you the details about the iPhone 8's 6-core A11 Bionic CPU, which it shares with the iPhone X. Just know this: In some benchmarks, it scores as well as Mac laptops. What can you do with a phone that fast? Those new camera tricks, plus hig'"

4,Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Little noticed amid the hype around the newest iPhones is the boon that the new wave of fancy phones means for the makers of memory chips inside. Apple's new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models hit stores on Friday. The iPhone X, with a bigger, sharper display and no home button, goes on sale in early November. That phone sets a record with a starting price tag of $999, while the other models sell for $200-$300 less. But all are offering a fairly sizable boost in memory and storage over previous iPhone iterations, a necessity given the demands of newer processors along with Apple's business need to sell more content and services per device. On storage, Apple has effectively doubled up on the previous iPhone generation. The lowest configuration available on the new models is now 64GB compared with 32GB in the iPhone 7. The more spacious option has doubled to 256GB. System memory is also getting a boost. The iPhone X and 8 Plus models both come with 3GB of DRAM, according to an estimate from Cowen & Co. That DRAM count was previously only available on the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has been steadily raising the amount of DRAM per phone over the past few years, as the company's core central processors have become more robust. Two years ago, most iPhones had only 1GB of DRAM or less. Other smartphone makers have been following the same track, some of which pack in far more memory in their phones than Apple. New top-of-the-line devices from Samsung Electronics and LG use 6GB of DRAM. That all adds up to good news for SK Hynix, Micron and Toshiba, along with Samsung's chip division. Memory prices have been on a steady rise since last year, as demand continues to outstrip supply. Spot prices for the most common type of DRAM in September were up more than 90% from the same point last year, with NAND Flash prices up 50% in that time, according to DRAMeXchange. That explains in part why Apple, which needs to maintain its famously high margins, has boosted prices in this latest iPhone generation. That means the price increases are unlikely to raise the company's overall profits. A small bummer for shareholders, but Apple has little choice but to play the right chips to stay in the game. '"
5,Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'NEW DELHI??Alphabet Inc.'s Google is aiming for a piece of India's booming??but increasingly crowded??mobile-payments business. The Mountain View, Calif., tech giant on Monday launched its first-ever smartphone app that lets users transfer money to individuals and businesses in the country without the use of a credit or a debit card, a crucial factor since many here lack plastic. Millions of Indian consumers have been ditching bills in favor of mobile-payments apps after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government made its surprise move last year to take 86% of currency out of circulation in an effort to curb corruption and bring more people into the tax net. The move triggered a cash crunch. ""ia will leapfrog markets like the U.S. and Europe"" in terms of adoption of mobile payments, Caesar Sengupta, a Google vice president, told the media in New Delhi. Services such as Apple Inc.'s Apple Pay and Samsung Electronics Co.'s Samsung Pay are increasingly popular in some developed countries. But they face competition from widely used credit cards and haven't really taken hold in emerging markets. Google's app, called Tez, lets Android and Apple users send money from their bank accounts or receive it via a simple interface that resembles a chat app and works in seven Indian languages. The app's launch is Google's latest move to customize products for India's nascent internet economy, which analysts say it wants to tap to ramp up advertising revenue globally. The firm has joined with the Indian government to provide free Wi-Fi at railway stations and has released special apps for the market, such as a version of YouTube that works even with patchy internet connections. ""Google is late on this thing but they can easily scale it up,"" said Tarun Pathak, an analyst at research firm Counterpoint. Some 96% of smartphone users in India are on Google's Android mobile-operating system, he said, and the service could grow quickly if users flock to it. While Google says it isn't charging users or merchants for the service, Mr. Pathak said Google could one day use it to collect data for advertising purposes. Google declined to say if it has plans to bring the app to additional emerging countries, like Indonesia and Brazil, but said it holds promise for such markets. Google's new app faces some serious rivals. India's market leader, Paytm, boasts more than 225 million users and in May raised $1.4 billion from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp., which it is using to fuel its expansion. India's biggest local messaging app, Hike, in June launched a mobile-payments feature, while Facebook Inc.'s WhatsApp??which has some 200 million users in India??is exploring adding digital payments in India. "" see our primary competitor as cash,"" said Google Vice President Diana Layfield, stressing that the company views mobile payments as being in their infancy in India. Mr. Sengupta said Tez, which means ""fast"" in Hindi, has already attracted about 50,000 users in recent days ahead of its official launch. iit o'"
6,Mon Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Thorstein Veblen was a cranky Norwegian-born economist who coined the phrase ""conspicuous consumption"" and theorized that certain products could defy the economic laws of gravity by stoking more demand with superhigh prices. His 1899 book, ""Theory of the Leisure Class,"" made him famous in his time and more than a century later his ideas are embodied in products like Hermes handbags, Bugatti cars and Patek Philippe watches. Now Apple and Samsung are testing whether the social commentator's theory on what has come to be known as the ""Veblen good"" can work for one of the most common of all consumer products -- the phone. The gambit is striking because prices tend to fall in technology and products become obsolete fast. In this case, though, it just might work in its own way. Typically, raising the price of a good lowers demand for it. If beef becomes too expensive, people will buy more chicken. Mr. Veblen's theory posits that some consumers want a product even more when the price rises because the expense broadcasts status, taste and wealth. By unveiling the new iPhone X last week with a price of $1,000, Apple Inc. is pushing the envelope even further than Samsung Electronics Co., which unveiled the $950 Note 8 phone this year. Rather than trying to attract consumers with cheaper prices, the companies are fighting for customers with expensive price tags. The starting price of the new flagship iPhone X is about 50% more than the $650 starting price of last year's iPhone 7. The most expensive version of the iPhone X, with 256 gigabytes of storage, will cost 19% more than last year's most expensive device, the iPhone 7 Plus, with the same memory. Apple and Samsung have found themselves here partly by necessity. Smartphone makers are running out of new customers. Data from IHS Markit estimates there are just under 100 smartphones per 100 people in the U.S. and about 92 smartphones per 100 people in Europe. (Many people own more than one phone.) By 2020, there will be about 84 smartphones per 100 people globally, IHS projects. To generate more revenue the big smartphone makers increasingly need to push on price. ""They can create a superpremium model and perception of superpremium that pushes those buyer types into the stratosphere,"" said Steven Haines, chief executive of Sequent Learning Networks, which advises companies on product management. ""This is classic product management."" Such segmentation is normal in mature industries, said Mr. Haines, comparing smartphones to what happened with the auto industry, where luxury cars with high prices became a status symbol as car ownership became commonplace. Apple has made the case that the technology in its new phone justifies the price. Chief Executive Tim Cook said the iPhone X will feature ""more powerful technologies than we've ever put in an iPhone before."" That includes a host of new components and features, including a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode display, a depth-sensing camera system for facial recognition, and gyroscopes and accelerometers for augmented reality -- a platform that puts virtual images of items like an IKEA sofa onto the smartphone screen so users can see how it would look in a living room. The components cost an estimated $581, up from $248 for iPhone 7 components, according to Susquehanna International Group. The gap suggests Apple's profit margins on the new device are slimmer than on existing lines. Still, conspicuous consumption appears to be a growing factor in the economics of smartphones. The market research group NPD, which tracks sales of new iPhones, finds spikes in sales volumes when new phones are launched. The biggest spikes came for iPhones that were the most visibly distinct, such as 2014's iPhone 6, the model in which Apple changed the shape, enlarged the device and raised prices by $100. The iPhone 6 ""made it obvious, even at a quick glance, which consumers had the latest and greatest device when they pulled out their phone to check an email or answer a call,"" wrote Eddie Hold, the president of Connected Intelligence, a group at NPD that studies mobile technology. ""You talk to people, and you hear this lust for a product,"" said Horace Dediu, an industry analyst at Asymco and a former Nokia Corp. business development executive. ""Technology has risen in our lives to become a reflection of us."" Still, Mr. Dediu said the iPhone X isn't a pure example of Veblen's theory because demand will be driven by the device's functionality, not simply price. While some new iPhones that look different will be bought to show off, he doesn't think anyone is sitting inside the company's headquarters thinking: How do we create that phenomenon? ""They're focused on making the best phone in the world,"" Mr. Dediu said. Putting out an iPhone 8 and an iPhone X at the same time suggests Apple is trying to create a prestige factor, said Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies consumer culture. ""They're clearly trying to demarcate the iPhone X from the other versions, and surely there's a desire to make it a status good,"" she said, noting that the iPhone X doesn't appear to offer significantly greater utility to most consumers than the other iterations of the iPhone. ""Are you getting some extra utility out of this good?"" said Ms. Currid-Halkett. ""I think the answer is no. I don't think a new animated emoji is better functionality. But it's cool."" '"

8,Mon Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'The big letdown from Apple's product announcement last Tuesday was news that its most desirable new gadget, the iPhone X, can't be preordered until late October and won't start shipping until November. Even then, analysts are predicting supply shortages. Dealers in Hong Kong expect to sell the phones at a $300 to $400 premium in the first weeks they are available. Shortages of hot new gadgets are so common, it is easy to take them for granted. This past year alone, Google's Pixel phone, Nintendo's Switch and classic gaming-system reboot, and even Apple's iPhone 7 Plus have been thin on the ground. You would think after years of hard-won experience, tech hardware companies could deliver goods when and where there is demand -- especially at Applewhose chief executive, Tim Cook, made his name as an operations maestro. Are these shortages some kind of Machiavellian marketing play? Calculated risk management? Or is it the case that manufacturing millions of complex electronic gadgets, and distributing them globally, is really hard? It is likely a bit of all of these. Companies often force early adopters to wait. This is because of the increasingly important preorder period, says Asokan Ashok, who was at Samsung Research America from 2009 to 2015, most recently as the director of emerging products and services, and saw many of Samsung's flagship products go from the lab to the consumer. He says the preorder mechanism, where customers signal their intent to buy a product before it starts shipping, provides early data that is essential to predicting demand for a gadget and distribution of demand across its various configurations -- both notoriously difficult to forecast. The calculus gets trickier when the device's price hits a new high and the company has no precedent to gauge demand, says Mr. Ashok, now chief executive of mobile software startup UnfoldLabs. That is certainly the case with the $999 iPhone X. Apple has ""never gone there before,"" he says. Apple may well be facing its biggest demand-forecasting challenge since the original iPhone. While Apple has empirical data on demand for new iPhones, it is harder to know what proportion of orders will be for the iPhone X versus its somewhat less pricey new siblings, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. In addition, many analysts are predicting this could be a ""super cycle"" of upgraders who have been holding out for a complete redesign -- leading to a sales surge such as the one caused by the 2014 launch of the iPhone 6. One reason forecasting demand matters so much is the rise in just-in-time manufacturing. Producing millions of phones means coordinating a symphony of component manufacturers, all delivering parts on demand. These partners can't risk unsold inventory eating into their already razor-thin profit margins. The result is that electronics tend to ship directly from factory to retailer. Asked about production delays for the iPhone X, a spokeswoman for Apple said only that the November ship date was reflected in financial estimates Apple gave in July. One of the biggest challenges top-tier manufacturers face in delivering product on time is their own exacting standards, says Mr. Ashok. Apple is notorious for changing small but important details of its final hardware designs more or less at the last minute. That perfectionism isn't unwarranted, because hardware can't be revised once it's in the hands of the consumer, and the cost of recalls, such as Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 battery-fire fiasco, can be enormous. Even relocating a single screw can have consequences for the dimensions, placement and performance of dozens of other components, says Chetan Sharma, a mobile-industry consultant. Details like this can be worked out in advance given enough time, but in the cutthroat mobile industry, time is something even Apple doesn't have. When a company brings in new technology -- such as the iPhone X's OLED display, not seen in any previous iPhone -- the headaches multiply. ""Yield"" is the percentage of a batch of components that meets production standards. Yield is the enemy of first-time technologies, says Wayne Lam, the principal analyst for smartphone electronics at IHS Markit. ""On the original iPhone, yield rates for capacitive touch [screens] were like 80% because it was new technology,"" says Mr. Lam. Throwing out one in five displays means absorbing a huge cost, he adds. (Apple's touch-screen yields have since risen, he says.) Sometimes, a component is scarce at any price. Nearly every smart gadget you can name contains NAND memory, which retains data when powered off. This key component has lately faced a global supply crunch. ""It's sort of like OPEC,"" Mr. Lam says. Just as refineries will contract with oil companies years in advance, giants such as Apple will make deals for enormous quantities of NAND memory, squeezing out smaller competitors. Even Apple can't get around what may be the most critical bottleneck for the iPhone X. At present, analysts say, only one conglomerate can manufacture that OLED screen -- and it is Apple's biggest smartphone competitor. Granted, Samsung Electronics' visual display business is separate from its mobile business, but Apple appears to be trying to bring in other partners to make OLED displays, including Japan Display and LG Display. Manufacturing smartphones is so complicated, it's a minor miracle they get to us at all. Companies control whatever they can by pre-announcing products, collecting preorders, stoking demand and, when necessary, managing expectations. They even ponder how much scarcity may increase desire -- so that when the product does arrive, weeks or even months later, it feels like it was worth the wait. '"
9,Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'It was the anticipation of nagging that led Christy Spitler to spy on her parents. The 21-year-old University of Alabama senior was home on break in Maryville, Tenn., when her parents left for a July weekend, telling her to keep the house clean. Instead, ""I left dishes out, and I would just leave my clothes on the floor,"" she says. No worries -- she was tracking her parents on an iPhone app that showed their whereabouts on a map. An hour before the app suggested they would return, she vacuumed, did the dishes and mopped. Otherwise, ""I really just sat around and watched Netflix and YouTube the whole weekend."" Parents have always snooped on their children, and smartphones have given them a new way to do it. A Pew Research Center survey published last year found 16% of parents of children aged 13 through 17 used monitoring tools on their phones to track them. But Mom and Dad can find themselves outfoxed. Ms. Spitler and others use programs such as Find My Friends, an Apple Inc. app that lets owners of iPhones, iPads and some other devices share their locations with specified contacts. Get your parents to sign on, and you can monitor their movements and shenanigans. Alexa McDonald of Columbus, Ohio, discovered that her parents fib a bit. The 24-year-old call-center dispatcher's app revealed that, while claiming to be stuck in traffic, they were sometimes at a restaurant. ""I never called them out on it, but inside in my head I was like, 'I'm hungry, I would have loved to have been included in that.'"" ""I guess we've done that,"" says her mother, Claudia McDonald of Mount Vernon, Ohio. One reason: ""Whatever the dish is, she always wants shrimp on it,"" she says. ""It's one of the more expensive things on the menu."" Apple declined to comment on children who monitor parents, other than to say Find My Friends lets users control what data is shared. Apple in promotional material says it might be used to ""notify you automatically when a friend arrives at the airport, a child leaves school, or a family member arrives home safely."" An app similar to Apple's, Life360, lets people agree to track each other on Android devices and iPhones. Children using it often set a 10-minute radius around their houses to get an alert when a parent is nearing, says Life360 CEO Chris Hulls. Between parents and children, he says, ""I would actually say it's almost equal in our situation about who is quote-unquote tracking who."" Jamie Barnhill, a senior at University of California, Davis, keeps an eye on her parents with Life360. One night at school, she saw they were just arriving home in Bakersfield, Calif. It was 1 a.m. ""I just remember seeing it and thinking, 'Wow, this is so sad. My parents were out later than I was,' "" she said. Her father, Terry Barnhill, says they likely had dinner and maybe saw a late movie or went out for drinks. ""It was perfectly legal,"" he says. ""Just because we're older adults, we're not confined to our homes."" Other apps on parents' phones work, too, as Joel Morton found. Mr. Morton, 22, a recent University of North Carolina graduate living at home near Charlotte, N.C., says when he helped his parents set up their iPhones about five years ago, he downloaded Find My iPhone, an app now included in Apple's operating system that helps an owner locate a misplaced phone. Because he knew the passwords to find his parents' phones, it dawned on him that ""I could use this whenever I need it."" When his parents left town once this year, he hosted friends overnight, setting an alarm for 8 a.m. to check their location. He saw they hadn't left the inn and went back to bed. Later, when he suddenly saw them on the move, ""I just frantically ran around trying to clean everything up, making sure everyone had left the house."" He says his parents weren't aware of his monitoring until he told them this week. Phone snooping exposed a parental ruse for a 25-year-old Houston medical assistant. Tired of her parents' unannounced visits to her apartment -- and lectures about the mess -- she followed them on Find My Friends. She says her parents once told her they were going to San Antonio, about 200 miles away, to celebrate their anniversary. Instead, ""we found out they went to a hotel like 30 minutes away."" She suspects they concocted the tale as an explanation for her younger sister, who was around 10 years old. ""I really just think they wanted their alone time."" For Ms. Spitler, the University of Alabama senior, tracking her parents not only helps her procrastinate on chores, it also eases her worries when they don't answer calls and texts. ""Sometimes I get a little creative with my imagination and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, they've been abducted.'"" Her mother, Cynthia Spitler, says she knew her daughter monitored her. ""It really just kind of makes me laugh,"" the elder Ms. Spitler says. ""If they're mature enough to figure out these devious ways to get around what they're supposed to be doing, they're mature enough to step up and do what they're supposed be doing."" '"
10,Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Good morning. Today is my last day filling in for Lara, and I'm going to make it count. Last week, Facebook found itself embroiled in an ongoing controversy after it disclosed it sold ads to fake accounts with ties to Russia during the U.S. election. This week, the social media giant is once again playing defense over its advertising practices. More below on the drama and response. TGIF. Not by the Book Facebook may have cleaned up the controversial feature that allowed advertisers to target people based on race, but the social network forgot to tell its algorithm not to generate offensive ad categories. ProPublica has found that marketers can target ads to custom groups of people on Facebook that include ""Jew hater"" and ""How to burn jews."" The anti-Semitic categories are created by an algorithm (not people) based on what users shares on Facebook and what's conveyed through their online activity. After the investigative news outlet found it could direct ads at the news feeds of almost 2,300 people who fell into such categories, Facebook said it would remove the categories and look for ways to better monitor categories before they are displayed to advertisers. ??Rough Week?? Facebook was busy updating its ad practices Thursday. Facebook had been allowing advertisers that promote news articles on the site to change the headlines and descriptions that appear with them. After CMO Today's Jack Marshall pointed to examples of story headlines that had been modified to subtly reposition coverage of a company or product, Facebook said it would stop allowing advertisers to modify the posts. ""ile they should be able to edit links pointing to their own material, they shouldn't be able to edit headlines on stories they didn't create,"" a Facebook spokesman said. Apple Season Six advertising trade associations, including the 4As, Association of National Advertisers and Interactive Advertising Bureau, have teamed up to protest Apple's latest move to block advertisers from collecting certain data that helps them target ads to Apple device users. Apple has said its new browser version, which will block access to ""cookie"" files stored on users' devices, is designed to better protect user privacy. The trade bodies argued it will make advertising more generic and less useful, resulting in a bad experience for consumers. Do consumers really like any kind of ads? Maybe once in awhile, but ad-blocking data would suggest that for the most part, it's a no. Also, it's unclear how much influence an angry ad trade association can have on a company like Apple that doesn't even have much of an ad business. Nonetheless, 'A' for effort. A Stream of Nominations Remember when it was a big deal that an Amazon show was even in the running for an Emmy? Now Hulu and Netflix have shows nominated for the night's biggest honor, Outstanding Drama Series. A win in the coveted category would be the first for a streaming service, shining a light on how much the TV business has changed in recent years. Speaking at an event hosted by the Paley Center on Thursday, Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins said a win for ""The Handmaid's Tale"" could help attract and retain new subscribers, as well as gain respect in the creative community. ""It lets creators know they have a shot,"" he told Wall Street Journal media editor Amol Sharma on stage. Still, as WSJ's John Jurgensen pointed out, if NBC wins for ""This Is Us,"" it will end an 11-year dry spell for broadcast TV. Either way, Sunday's Emmy Awards will be telling for a fast-changing business. Throwing Shade Competition is heating up among TV networks and new streaming services, but that doesn't mean the networks themselves aren't still at each other's throats. CBS Chief Les Moonves, speaking at the Goldman Sachs media conference Thursday, criticized Disney for investing in a streaming business versus growing one internally, and ESPN for not having enough hard-core sports content, according to the Hollywood Reporter. He also expressed confidence in CBS's ability to reach the growing number of cord-cutters who are shaking up the TV business. ??More from Goldman?? If anything, CBS has one less competitor to worry about on the news front. At the conference, Sinclair Broadcast CEO Chris Ripley squashed speculation that the company is planning to launch a national news network, according to WSJ's Joe Flint. Speaking at the same event, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said the wireless giant no longer wants to buy a cable company (WSJ reported in January that Verizon had explored a deal with Charter). The company also said it's cutting $10 billion in spending over the next four years and adopting zero-based budgeting??an approach that could have implications for everything from ad spend to investment in its new Yahoo-AOL group called Oath.

11,Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Discounts on Apple Inc.'s newest iPhone models haven't kept up with their climbing prices. Wireless carriers are offering less generous deals on new iPhones than in years past as executives bristle at the handsets' cost. Apple on Tuesday unveiled two iPhone 8 models starting at $699 alongside a premium device, the iPhone X, for $999. That is up from a base price of $649 last year for the iPhone 7. The rising cost is prompting wireless companies to look for other ways to lure customers to their service. Buying a new handset is often the easiest way for the carriers to steal subscribers from rivals, but the cost of the devices, which customers usually pay back over time at zero interest, cuts into their profitability. ""I think we should invite the manufacturers to share a little of the cash flow burden,"" Sprint Corp. Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said at an investor conference in New York Thursday. ""We're not too excited with the prices going up and also having to finance that."" Mr. Claure said Sprint isn't planning to let customers have a $999 iPhone X without at least making a down payment or paying interest, though it hasn't made a final decision about how it will be sold. ""The model is not sustainable where we are buying devices at high prices and then were just basically providing interest-free financing to customers,"" he said. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Last year, shortly after Apple unveiled the iPhone 7, the four major U.S. carriers were quick to offer free iPhone 7s to customers who traded in the previous model. This time, executives say they don't want the newest iPhones to spark another promotional brawl. ""I'm encouraged, frankly, by the discipline there appears to be around promotions for the iPhone,"" Verizon Communications CEO Lowell McAdam said Thursday, adding that the discipline will help the company boost revenue following price cuts and its return to unlimited data plans earlier this year. Mr. Claure, who echoed Mr. McAdam's pleasure with the soft promotions, said Sprint would respond aggressively to any rival offers but doesn't want to take the first swing. ""In the case that somebody becomes aggressive, we are going to be the one with the most enticing offer,"" he said. ""But so far things seem to be very responsible, which is good."" Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack said most companies' promotions focused on trade-in offers for old devices, ""a much more measured approach than the free-iPhone deals we saw last year."" AT&T Inc. said it would broaden an existing buy-one-get-one offer to include a $699 credit for iPhone buyers adding a second phone line. But the deal only applies to the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, not the iPhone X, and subscribers also need DirecTV or U-verse to qualify. Verizon and T-Mobile US Inc. are both offering trade-in customers as much as $300 off the newest models instead of the $650 credits on tap last year, which covered the cost of a basic iPhone 7. The major carriers also let customers finance the latest devices over 24 months. '"

The major carriers also let customers finance the latest devices over 24 months, in some cases upgrade again next year. Apple has an installment program, which costs $50 a month, that includes its AppleCare insurance and free upgrades each year. Mike Sievert, T-Mobile's chief operating officer, said last year's deep discounts weren't as effective as the company had hoped. ""Within a few days, everybody had copied it,"" he said on Thursday. ""What exactly does this accomplish?"" T-Mobile's network could be another reason for caution. Apple's new devices aren't compatible with a sliver of airwave licenses T-Mobile bought for $8 billion earlier this year. Samsung Electronic Co.'s latest device also doesn't support the frequency, which the company is counting on to give it an edge over competitors. People keep their phones for about 2? years, so T-Mobile has an incentive to make its customers upgrade later, when more devices work with its full network. Mr. Sievert suggested as much Thursday, noting this year's iPhone was never part of its plans when it plotted the network expansion. A T-Mobile spokeswoman said the company doesn't want its customers to hesitate to buy a new phone if they are ready to upgrade. For now, T-Mobile's most generous offer applies to customers who stick it out until 2018. Members of its upgrade program can trade in today's new iPhone for the next-generation version, expected a year from now, and have the carrier pay off the remaining balance on their old device. '"
13,Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Six advertising trade associations, including the 4As, Association of National Advertisers and Interactive Advertising Bureau, have teamed up to protest Apple's latest move to block advertisers from collecting certain data that helps them target ads to Apple device users. The organizations, which represent ad agencies and marketers, issued a letter outlining their concerns over Apple's Safari 11 web browser, which is due to be released on September 19. The new browser version is expected to feature an ""Intelligent Tracking Prevention"" tool designed to block access to ""cookie"" files stored on users' devices, which marketers and advertising companies use to target, track and measure their ads. Apple said the change is designed to better protect user privacy, but the trade bodies argued it will make advertising more generic and less useful, resulting in a bad experience for consumers. ""Apple's Safari move breaks [existing internet] standards and replaces them with an amorphous set of shifting rules that will hurt the user experience and sabotage the economic model for the Internet,"" the letter states. The development also highlights ongoing tensions between marketers, advertising companies and major tech firms as it relates to the collection and use of consumer data. Companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon rely heavily on the ability to track users' online behaviors to drive their businesses, while Apple has in recent years stifled their ability to do so via its devices. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. Apple's Safari had a 51.6% share of the U.S. browser market in August, according to online analytics company StatCounter, compared to a 38.7% share for Google Chrome's. Apple's latest Safari update is a headache for advertisers already grappling with a growing number of consumers blocking digital ads they deem annoying. EMarketer estimates that in 2016, 64.6 million Americans used an ad blocker. The research company predicts the figure will grow to 75.1 million people in 2017. The anti-advertising push is spreading. Google is also planning to introduce an ad-blocking feature on its popular Chrome web browser sometime next year, according to people familiar with the company's plans. The Alphabet Inc.-owned company is working with publishers to prepare for the new ad filter, which will weed out ads deemed to provide a bad ad experience for users. The ad types on the chopping block are those that were chosen by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group made up of various trade bodies. '"

It seems fair to say, as much of the AR startup universe did on Tuesday, that Apple Inc.'s decision to become a player in the development of the augmented reality ecosystem paves the way for mass adoption of AR-related games, consumer services and enterprise opportunities. But a couple of caveats are in order??especially as venture investors step up their interest in the emerging technology. AR-related venture capital deals world-wide have climbed to more than $93 million this year to date, compared with $60 million last year and nearly $20 million in 2015, according to PitchBook Data Inc. After all, Apple's upcoming version of its iOS operating system potentially creates an addressable market in the hundreds of millions for AR developers and content creators. They will have their work cut out for them. That's because they are coming in an era when iPhone and Android users alike have developed app fatigue from the sheer app options, using them less. And most of the wizardry that Apple put on display at the Steve""obs Theater on Tuesday was about giving people the ability to stick a 3D object into a piece of video or other imagery. As cool as it might look on the surface, there's not a lot changing the game there. So what will get AR to a scale that should interest venture investors?

16,Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'A group including Apple Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. surged to the front of a hotly contested race to acquire Toshiba Corp.'s memory-chip business, a crucial supplier to some of the world's biggest makers of electronic gear. Toshiba said Wednesday it had signed a nonbinding agreement with the leader of the group, private-equity firm Bain Capital, and intends to reach a deal by the end of September. The bid values the business at about $19 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The development is the latest twist in a global auction that has pitted three major bidders against each other and exposed a rift between Toshiba and a key partner, Western Digital Corp., which is also vying for the business. At stake is control over a key building block in everything from smartphones to heavy-duty computing machines. Toshiba is racing to strike a deal in the wake of huge losses at its U.S. nuclear unit, Westinghouse Electric Co., which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. The Tokyo company has said it needs to sell the profitable memory unit to bring its shareholder equity back into positive territory by the end of its fiscal year in March 2018. Otherwise, its shares would face delisting under Tokyo Stock Exchange rules. Besides Apple and Dell, the Bain group includes disk-drive maker Seagate Technology PLC and others, and more tech and financial players may join, according to people familiar with the matter. It also includes South Korean chip maker SK Hynix Inc., as well as Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a fund backed by the Japanese government, and government-owned Development Bank of Japan, other people said. The scrum highlights the strategic importance of the Toshiba business, which makes NAND flash memory chips used for data storage in smartphones, computers and other electronics. Apple and Dell, which would likely supply debt financing for a Bain bid, want to ensure the Toshiba unit remains a viable supplier, according to people familiar with the matter. The tech heavyweights also want the unit to stay competitive with Samsung Electronics Co., the leader in flash memory chips and a major rival to Apple. ""This shows the dire situation that the flash memory industry is in with high prices and low availability over an extended period of time,"" said Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy. ""Companies need this storage to ship and sell products at a profit."" The Bain consortium's plan would be to take the chip business private as an independent entity and bring it public again at a later date in Japan, one person said. It is far from clear that a resolution to the monthslong saga is at hand. A number of constituents with disparate interests have to agree before a deal can be completed, and a host of regulators would have to sign off. In June, Toshiba selected a group including Bain and SK Hynix as the preferred bidder before those talks stalled. Toshiba, which said Wednesday that Bain had made a new offer, added in its statement that the memorandum doesn't preclude talks with other bidding groups. At various points in the negotiations, Toshiba has leaned toward another bidding group that includes Western Digital, a U.S. maker of hard-disk drives that is the Japanese company's partner in the memory-chip business. But the parties haven't been able to agree on how much influence Western Digital would have following a deal. They are now openly at odds, with Western Digital insisting it has veto rights over any sale and Toshiba saying that isn't true. The two sides are headed for international arbitration. A spokeswoman for Western Digital, which has joined buyout giant KKR & Co. on a bid, said the company is ""disappointed"" by Toshiba's move and still wants to reach a deal. Meanwhile, the Japanese government has raised objections to another bid led by Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., because of the company's extensive operations in China. Some government officials believe Foxconn's China ties could result in Japanese technology leaking to that country. Given how the deal has captivated Wall Street, some of those working on it have taken to calling it privately the ""RJR Nabisco of tech"" -- a reference to the 1980s-era leveraged buyout memorialized in the book ""Barbarians at the Gate."" Toshiba's flash-memory chips are used not just in smartphones but also in servers for cloud services, internet-connected devices and other products, demand for which is on the rise. Whether Toshiba sells the unit to one of the three bidder groups or decides not to sell after all -- still a significant possibility -- that robust demand is the backdrop for the spirited sales process. In Toshiba's results for the April-June quarter, sales for the segment that includes memory chips rose 23% and operating profit for that segment was greater than the company's total operating profit. About 30% of the NAND supply in the new iPhones Apple unveiled this week comes from Toshiba -- with 30% from Western Digital, 25% from SK Hynix and the rest from Samsung and Micron Technology, Inc., according to estimates by Susquehanna International Group. A Western Digital acquisition of Toshiba could give the U.S. company increased leverage at a time when NAND prices are already rising, some customers worry. '"

18,Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple Inc. needs the new iPhone X to be a hit in China, where its sales have been slumping for years -- which means it needs more Shirley Wangs. The 29-year-old hospital administrator says she won't be dissuaded by the base price of 8,388 yuan, or nearly $1,300, about $300 more than the phone will cost in the U.S. ""I'm a big fan of iPhones,"" said Ms. Wang, who was shopping near the Apple Store in Beijing's tony Sanlitun district Wednesday. ""A lot of my friends will buy them, too."" But in a country where domestic smartphones start at about $100, that may not be enough. Even the two lower-priced models Apple is rolling out -- the 5,888 yuan iPhone 8 and larger-screened 6,688 iPhone 8 Plus -- are beyond reach of many Chinese consumers. ""It's too pricey,"" said Mo Jia, an analyst for market researcher Canalys. Apple was at one time the top seller in China, the world's biggest smartphone market, and its brand still carries a matchless cachet for the status-conscious. But its market share has fallen to about 7%, from an estimated 16.5% in late 2014, as domestic rivals have made big technological strides -- and offered models adapted to local tastes. Still, greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, accounted for 22% of Apple's sales last year -- trailing only the U.S. and Europe. ""China is hugely important, both in terms of its market size now and future growth,"" said Duncan Clark, founder of tech consultancy BDA China. ""China is also a global test bed."" ""What Apple really needs with the iPhone in China is two things,"" said Ian Fogg, a senior director at consulting firm IHS Markit: to offer something ""demonstrably different"" than Chinese makers, and to overcome the challenges of being an overseas brand. The market leader in China is Shenzhen-based Huawei Technologies Co., whose share has doubled in the past three years, reaching 21% in the second quarter, according to Canalys. It is zeroing in on Apple's target high-end consumer. Earlier this year it launched its flagship P10 phone, which carries a price tag of nearly $700 and features that include an improved dual-lens camera developed in partnership with German camera maker Leica. Coming next month: Huawei's Mate 10 smartphone, which is expected to have a new processor capable of photo-enhancing artificial intelligence and to offer faster charging and a longer battery life. A price hasn't yet been announced, though Huawei typically undercuts Apple. China's Xiaomi Inc. on Monday introduced its costliest phone yet, the 4,000 yuan Mi Mix 2, featuring a full-screen display. Vivo, China's No. 3 smartphone maker, is set to launch its X20 full-screen phone later this year. To win back Chinese market share, Apple tailored a number of features on its latest operating system to Chinese consumers -- including a built-in ability to scan the country's ubiquitous QR codes, which are used to shop and send money across China. Users can also ask Siri to pull up their WeChat QR codes, used to connect with friends on the app. It also includes features like dictation in Shanghainese, and Chinese traffic cameras on Apple maps. Apple also added the ability to use a phone number rather than an email address as Apple ID, after realizing how rarely email is used in China compared with texts and WeChat. Notably, Apple is launching the ability for friends to pay each other on iMessage via Apple Pay in the U.S., but not in other markets. Apple Pay operates in China, but the mobile-payment market is dominated by domestic systems Alipay and WeChat Pay. Whether Apple's efforts bear fruit won't be known for weeks, or even months. The two iPhone 8 models will go on sale Sept. 22, but the iPhone X -- plagued by production difficulties this summer -- won't hit shelves until Nov. 3. Xia Giang, a 30-year-old startup founder, is taking a wait-and-see approach. ""Maybe I'll buy it,"" Mr. Xia said. ""Money isn't an issue, but I want to know if my friends like it. I'll let them try it first and then decide."" '"
19,Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Hold your iPhone 6, 6s or 7 in your hand. Close your eyes and imagine it with a shinier glass back, a speedier processor, improved cameras and wireless charging. Now you're holding an iPhone 8! That may sound like a perfectly good upgrade, and on Tuesday it was the best iPhone Apple ever introduced -- until a few minutes later, when the company showed off the iPhone X, which has all of that and more. Apple's iPhone lineup is now as crowded as a minivan on summer vacation, and the iPhone 8, the would-be star, is a middle child in a middle seat. At Apple's event in Cupertino, Calif., I had a chance to try out all three new models, and there's no doubt: The 4.7-inch iPhone 8 ($699 and up) and the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus ($799 and up) are very good devices. The glass back gives them a fresh feel, and they handled graphics-intensive augmented-reality apps like champs. I had a lot of fun with the iPhone 8 Plus's improved camera portrait tricks. If the iPhone X is the phone of the future, the iPhone 8 is more like a ""just right"" Goldilocks phone of the present. But when you look at it in the context of its iPhone alternatives, it seems lost in limbo. iPhone 6s ($449 and up). Seriously, Apple has kept this 2015 phone in the mix. (In smartphone years, it's well past retirement age.) For $450, you get a phone that looks similar to the 8. Though behind in camera quality, battery life and performance, it has some of Apple's most recent tricks, including Live Photos and a 3D Touch screen. If there ever were a budget iPhone that still competes with mid-priced Androids, this is it. iPhone 7 ($549 and up). The iPhone 7's price drop to $549 -- or $669 for the larger Plus -- makes it more desirable than ever. I promise you'll get over the missing headphone jack, and you'll enjoy the improved battery life and water resistance -- all of which remain the same on the 8. The iPhone 7 Plus also has a dual-camera system, though it doesn't get the new Portrait Lighting tricks. If you're upgrading from an older phone and don't want anything too large, the decision between a 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and the same-size iPhone 8 is the toughest one. Are you just paying $100 for a fancy glass back? Or are the camera and performance improvements meaningful? (If you can hold off on pre-ordering, you'll benefit from our detailed comparative testing, so stay tuned. You can also look at our iPhone X vs. iPhone 8 rundown here.) If you currently have a 7, jumping to the 8 doesn't make sense. Best to hold out for the X . . . or even the XI. iPhone X ($999 and up). You get it at this point: This is the phone to want. The edge-to-edge 5.8-inch OLED screen is bigger and way better than the iPhone 8 Plus's, yet the X is smaller and easier to manage in your hand. And when you're starting at $800, the $200 difference matters less and less. The front-facing camera will turn your face into your password -- or a talking poop emoji. The two rear cameras improve upon the iPhone 7 Plus's depth features. (The 4.7-inch iPhone 8 still has only one camera.) Plus, the iPhone X delivers two more hours of battery life, says Apple, compared with the iPhone 8 and 7. iPhone SE ($349 and up). If you want Apple's only remaining small phone, the 4-inch SE, at its new even-lower price, go ahead. You won't need my advice on any of the above. So as you imagine holding that shiny new iPhone 8 in your hand, remember: Pay a bit more, and you get the entirely redesigned iPhone X that truly feels different. Pay a bit less, and you get the not-too-distant past, which will still feel like the future to anyone with an iPhone 6s or earlier. '"
20,Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple's big, new iPhone has a tall order ahead. After two years of ho-hum sales, the world's most valuable company is looking to its newest smartphones to revive its growth story. The wildly successful iPhone 6 drove Apple's sales and earnings for fiscal 2015 to records, but later iPhone releases haven't measured up. Apple's revenue slipped nearly 8% the following year and is expected to rise less than 6% for the fiscal year ending Sept 30. So this year's new models revealed Tuesday -- the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus along with the redesigned iPhone X -- need to deliver enough growth to help Apple reach a new peak. Wall Street is forecasting iPhone unit sales of 247 million for the fiscal year that begins in October. That is about 7% higher than what Apple achieved in fiscal 2015 with the iPhone 6. Those estimates take into account the $1,000 starting price of the iPhone X, given months of news leaks on that point. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models start about 4% to 8% dearer than their predecessors. But, even with higher prices, the impact on Apple's earnings is less certain. Costs for key components such as memory and displays have risen sharply over the past year, which could eat into the company's profit margins. Analysts are projecting about $70.6 billion in operating income for Apple next year, which would be slightly below the record set in fiscal 2015 with the iPhone 6. Still, the new iPhones probably will deliver on those growth targets. It helps greatly that Apple has a large base of users still on the iPhone 6 and thus hungry for an upgrade. It also helps that Apple's users are a bit less sensitive to sticker shock. A survey by Barclays in August found that about 19% of iPhone users were willing to pay as high as $1,200 for a new smartphone, compared with about 6% of Android users. Apple also doesn't need all of this year's upgrade customers to flock to the most expensive iPhone X. The average selling price for the iPhone lineup is expected to hit about $692 in fiscal 2018, a 5% rise from what is expected this year. That implies a fair amount of the new, lower-priced iPhone 8 models in the mix. That is the most likely outcome given production constraints on the iPhone X that have pushed its initial shipping date to Nov. 3 -- six weeks after the launch of the other two new phones. Apple's share price slipped 0.4% on Tuesday, an understandable reaction given a run-up of nearly 40% this year. But at 15 times forward earnings, the stock still has some upside if early sales of the new phones prove stronger than expected. Getting the company to the vaunted market value of $1 trillion, however, remains a much tougher call. '"
21,Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'When you pick up Apple Inc.'s new iPhone X, instead of unlocking with your thumb, you stop and grin at the phone's front unibrow as a bank of cameras and sensors check to see if it is really you. At a demo after Tuesday's launch event, I timed the process at about a second. People unlock their phones hundreds of times a day, so this selfie ritual will turn iPhone X owners into the most-photographed population ever. And showing off the move to others is probably the best iPhone sales pitch in years -- even if this one costs $1,000 or more. I saw little evidence in Apple's demo that the iPhone X can kick-start a new decadelong tech revolution. Its most practically useful features may be a bigger screen and (Apple claims) two additional hours of battery life. Yet the X moves the ball forward for our most-used gadgets, making cameras and visual tech central to the future of the smartphone. As usual, Apple giveth and Apple taketh away. Let this sink in: The iPhone X has no home button or fingerprint reader. Not even buried behind the screen. The culprit, Apple says, is the nearly all-screen front, which leaves no space for a button. It is a design tweak that changes how we relate to our phones. The new screen gives you even more usable screen area than the iPhone 7 Plus in a form that is only slightly larger than the iPhone 7. The new OLED tech used in the screen makes images look rich, and contributes to the significant improvement in battery life. In my hand, it feels like a big little phone -- perhaps a tad weighty. It is also a screen style we've seen in rival phones from Samsung Electronics Co., which managed to actually curve its Galaxy S8 screen to the edge on the left and right side. The iPhone X still has a metal rim all the way around that looks like a car bumper. Samsung has (temperamental) face and iris unlocking features, but it kept the fingerprint reader on the rear of the phone as a surefire backup. How well does the face-unlock thing work? That will require some serious testing. In my brief postevent demo, Apple wouldn't let me register my own face. At least once, it missed the face of the Apple product rep. (In dark situations, the phone sends out a beam of light as well as an array of invisible dots to read your face.) And the whole process was slowed by a clunky design: After the phone recognizes your face, you have to swipe up from the bottom of the phone to get to your home screen. In fact, there is a whole bunch of new finger yoga you will need to learn. To get to the control center, instead of swiping up from the bottom you now have to drag a finger from the top right corner. And since there's no home button, you swipe up from the bottom to get back to your home screen. It reminded me of Snapchat -- and like it, I could see some people just wanting to opt out of the confusion. The reward for changing your muscle memory is, beyond the face-unlocking trick, a new way to think about what you can do with a camera. Apple is now putting a lot of energy (and money) into opening up the world of augmented reality, which I agree has huge potential -- even if its current applications are more goofy than serious. The front-facing cameras, buried in the screen's funny notch, get the biggest boost. They include infrared sensors to map your face. You can take selfies with artfully blurred-out backgrounds. A new effect that Apple calls Portrait Lighting lets you create dramatic lighting on and around your subjects. One of the most compelling demos I saw placed my head, live, in fun contexts, including the Millennium Falcon from ""Star Wars."" In the feature that might best sum up 2017, you can turn your head into an animated singing and dancing emoji, called animoji. Yep, you can send your boo a personalized poo face. The two back cameras are also improved over the iPhone 7 Plus, though less dramatically. The second lens, used for 2X telephoto shots, now has optical image stabilization that should make portraits and zoomed-in shots less blurry. The cameras are also now oriented vertically, which Apple says will help with future augmented reality apps. I won't have all the answers until I review the phone, but here's my initial takeaway: With the iPhone X, Apple's best no longer looks like a three-year-old phone. (Apple's other new phone, the iPhone 8, still does.) The face-unlocking trick is a strategy to make you feel like you are missing out if you don't have an iPhone X.

23,Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple Inc.'s new iPhone X ties the future of its flagship device to facial-recognition technology that could alter how people interact with their gadgets -- if the company can get it to work right. Facial-recognition is the most prominent new feature in the 10th-anniversary iPhone Apple unveiled on Tuesday. Called Face ID, it will be the primary tool to unlock the nearly $1,000 iPhone X, which is scheduled to start shipping Nov. 3. A camera system with depth sensors project 30,000 infrared dots across a user's face that computing systems use to create a mathematical model that is stored securely on the phone. Each time users hold the device to their faces, the technology verifies the mathematical model before unlocking the phone in an instant. As with other new smartphone technologies it has adopted in the past, Apple isn't the first to use facial recognition. But it hopes to be the best, popularizing a technology that has had a mixed record on other gadgets. Considering iPhone users on average unlock their devices 80 times a day, the success of Face ID could make or break the device, analysts says, especially after early users get their hands on it and begin sharing their experiences publicly. Apple on Tuesday inadvertently demonstrated the potential pitfalls. During a demonstration of the technology, the device failed to fully unlock the first time Apple's top software executive Craig Federighi used it before the audience. He resorted to typing in a passcode before switching to a backup iPhone X that he unlocked seamlessly with Face ID. ""It's got to work,"" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies. ""From a security standpoint and convenience standpoint, this is their idea of where the future of the smartphone goes."" If it catches on, the facial-scanning technology in iPhone X could unlock other changes in how we use smartphones. In one small example, Apple also is using the system to capture facial expressions and use them to animate images of chickens, unicorns and other common emojis. Those animojis, as Apple calls them, can be captured and shared with friends. Facial-recognition technologies have been used for more than five years in consumer devices, including some smartphones that use Google's Android operating system. But the technology that has been rolled out so far has faltered in security tests, said Marc Rogers, who previously discovered flaws in Apple's Touch ID system and now heads information security at Cloudflare Inc. Google warns users that with its face-recognition system, called Trusted Face, ""Someone who looks similar to you could unlock your phone."" Face-recognition technology is also used in Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 10 operating system and Samsung Electronics Co.'s Galaxy S8 mobile phone. One problem -- which doesn't affect Apple's device -- is that many other products with facial recognition rely on a single camera, which can be fooled into authenticating a photograph of a user under certain conditions, Mr. Rogers said. Fingerprint readers faced similar security questions because they were considered unreliable until Apple improved on the technology with its Touch ID fingerprint reader in 2013, Mr. Rogers said. Apple says it has overcome the single-camera issue by mapping the depth of faces. Marketing chief Phil Schiller said the system is sophisticated enough to adapt, even if someone changes their hairstyle, puts on glasses or grows a beard. He said it can't be tricked by photographs or facial masks and requires the user's attention, meaning the phone won't unlock if eyes are closed or someone is looking away. The chances an iPhone X could be unlocked with Face ID by someone other than its user are one in a million, Mr. Schiller said. That compares with one in 50,000 for Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor iPhones now use, which sits on a home button that Apple is eliminating for the iPhone X. Mr. Rogers of Cloudflare said the three-dimensional verification system of Face ID should defeat the ""flat image attack"" with photos that foiled other facial-recognition systems. However, he said Apple's switch to a new login method was risky because the Touch ID was used to not only unlock devices but also authenticate sensitive apps and make purchases with Apple Pay. ""They might be going too far this time,"" Mr. Rogers said. ""We'll see."" Investors are excited about the face-based functions on the new iPhone. They have sent Apple's stock up 39% this year betting the company's new devices will compel many existing iPhone owners with two-year-old devices to buy a new one. '"

25,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'It's the $1 trillion question in markets: Will Apple's latest iPhone be another hit? No matter the answer, investors might be wise to cool their bets on some of the U.S. tech giant's Asian suppliers: History suggests they don't do so well once the razzmatazz has passed. On average, iPhone suppliers have outperformed the market by 7.2% in the six months before a launch, only to underperform by 3.9% in the three months after, according to brokerage firm Bernstein. Prelaunch excitement has fueled the likes of AAC Technologies, an iPhone-speaker supplier whose share price is up 46% in the past three months -- even though analysts over that period have raised their earnings estimates for next year by only 9%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Around half of AAC's revenue is from Apple, according to Bernstein. The lens maker Largan and the microphone supplier Goertek, both with AAC-like levels of exposure to Apple, have also run significantly ahead of earnings expectations recently. A better iPhone bet may be component makers that take a smaller bite from Apple, but are riding the latest trends in smartphones. Take Sony, a supplier of iPhone image sensors: It gets less than 5% of its revenue from Apple, but should benefit from the shift toward dual lenses in phone cameras. Samsung Electronics should benefit as smartphones add more memory and sharper screens. As the hype around Apple's latest iPhone builds, investors should keep one eye on the likely winners and losers.

26,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'KYOTO, Japan -- A new phone-battery push by one of Japan's biggest parts makers is likely to increase competition among the companies that power smartphones from Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Murata Manufacturing Co. on Sept. 1 completed its roughly $160 million acquisition of Sony Corp.'s battery division, which introduced the first commercial lithium-ion battery a quarter-century ago. The parts maker's president, Tsuneo Murata, said he plans to boost capacity in hopes of luring ""a North American customer,"" a phrase often used by Japanese suppliers in the sector when referring to Apple. Tiny parts from Murata that control electricity flow, among other functions, are already found in most smartphones, including Apple's. In its annual supplier report, the iPhone maker lists 24 Murata factories, including 14 in Japan. ""We are already doing big business with a North American customer, and we believe their trust in us is high,"" Mr. Murata said during an interview Monday, ahead of Apple's introduction of its new iPhones Tuesday. ""We will respond to such expectations by investing actively."" Murata has said it will spend more than 50 billion yen ($457 million) over the next few years to beef up the newly acquired battery unit, with about half of the sum going toward increasing production capacity for batteries used in smartphones and tablets. Batteries can make or break a smartphone based on safety and their ability to pack a lot of charging power in a small space. Samsung had to pull its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone last year after consumer complaints that the phones caught fire. The former Sony unit now owned by Murata is known for using a gel instead of a liquid in the part of the battery where charged particles flow. Mr. Murata said the battery drew greater interest from smartphone makers after the Samsung incidents because the gel is viewed as safer, although it tends to reduce charging speed. ""The industry is paying more attention to the safety aspect of the battery instead of focusing on storing more energy in the same space,"" said Mr. Murata, the 66-year-old son of the company's founder. In its push to win more Apple business, Murata faces competition from Amperex Technology Ltd., a Hong Kong-based unit of Japan's TDK Corp., as well as South Korea's LG Chem Ltd. Current iPhones, including those released Tuesday, use batteries from those two companies, people familiar with the supply chain said. When it was part of Sony, the Murata battery unit occasionally supplied Apple for the iPhone but never became a major supplier, engineers at the unit said. ""When at Sony, the unit wasn't able to do business it could have done because of the capacity issue,"" Mr. Murata said. ""We won't hesitate in making such investments."" Samsung had been using TDK batteries for some of its products, including the Galaxy Note 7, but switched to those made by the former Sony unit after last year's recall, said people familiar with the supply chain. Samsung said in January that the fire problem was caused by the battery pack and that no issues were found with the handset and its software. A TDK spokesman said the company can't comment on issues related to its customers. Mr. Murata said capacity would start rising next year and he was willing to accelerate the $457 million investment plan depending on market conditions. ""Customers are demanding that we boost supply as soon as possible,"" he said. The company has plenty of financial muscle: With annual sales of more than $10 billion, Murata sports a market capitalization of about $34 billion. Still, Mr. Murata expressed caution about relying too heavily on smartphones. The company wants to reach new customers such as the makers of connected cars and power tools, he said. The company also says its batteries and systems could help homeowners store and use electricity generated by rooftop solar panels. '"
27,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'The Apple Watch got its second major update since its spring 2015 launch. While it still has the same recognizable rounded-square shape, the $399 Watch Series 3 now connects directly to cellular networks, as expected. It doesn't require an iPhone, or even a Wi-Fi network, to function. Apple says the new Watch has a new processor that is 70% faster and a custom wireless chip for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The device has a barometric altimeter for measuring things such as flights of stairs. Apple intends for it to be used for new skiing and hiking apps. Like the previous Watch Series 2, the Series 3 has built-in GPS to track running and other long-distance workouts. For people who don't want the cellular version, there is a Series 3 without it for $329. An Apple Watch that connects to a 4G LTE wireless network means people can go longer without needing to carry an iPhone. You can make calls, stream music and talk to Siri. The cellular connectivity is packed in tight, facilitated by a tiny electronic SIM card -- not removable, but software configurable. The end result is that the Series 3 case is the same size as the Series 2 case, said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer. Apple hasn't fully decoupled the Watch from its smartphone master. You still need an iPhone to configure the apps on the device. In fact, the phone number is the same as your iPhone. New software makes more use of the heart-rate monitor built into all Apple Watches. Users will get more heart-rate data on demand and see a picture of their heart rate throughout the day. Other features were introduced in June with Apple WatchOS 4, which goes to all Apple Watch customers on Sept. 19. People can preorder the Apple Watch Series 3 on Sept. 15; it will be available in stores Sept. 22. AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. say adding Apple Watch Series 3 to your service plan for number sharing will cost $10 a month. '"

30,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Tuesday may have been the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, but Apple Inc. used the occasion to make a bet on a new technology. One of the co-stars of Apple's globally watched extravaganza was augmented reality, an emerging medium that has developed largely out of the view of the mass market??until now. Venture capitalists and other observers said that by embracing AR in its newest operating system, Apple has created in one fell swoop a tentpole moment for the AR universe. ""n the same way that the App Store launched hundreds of thousands of apps and thousands of companies in two-dimensional space, this is going to be an entirely new ecosystem for startups,"" said Josh Wolfe, managing partner of Lux Capital. At Apple's event to promote its next generation of iPhones and related products, the company showcased its foray into apps and devices incorporating augmented reality, which blends digital content with real-world scenes and even human facial expressions. For startups focused on AR, Apple's gambit to fold the technology into its iOS operating system represents a game-changing moment for their niche of the tech industry. ""It's a signal that immersive computing is ready to jump into everybody's hands,"" said Steve Raymond, chief executive of augmented-reality startup 8i Corp. The New Zealand-based company, which has raised $41 million from Signia Venture Partners and others, intends to release next week a mobile app on Apple's AR platform that lets people blend holographic content into videos and photos. Apple's iOS 11, coming out this fall, unlocks an enormous new market for startups developing games and advertising using augmented reality and functions resembling virtual reality. Apple, by persistently prompting people with software updates and new iPhone devices sporting the latest software, can quickly outsell demand on millions of units. ""iOS 11 in short order will have 500 million users,"" said Mihir Shah, founder and CEO of VR advertising startup Immersv. ""We can reach a large audience on a large platform. We're super excited about it."" Yet whether those millions of people using the new operating system also will get excited about AR remains an open question. Analysts say a kind of app fatigue has caused downloads of apps to drop sharply in the past couple of years; the challenge for third-party developers and content creators is to offer new, must-have features that people will want. Apple recently released its ARKit platform for developers to create products around AR, that will work with motion sensors and detection of facial expression. Ahead of Apple's theatrics for new devices, AR startups had been testing the tools in anticipation of the new market opportunity. Few startups benefited more immediately from Apple's attention on Tuesday than a venture-backed Shanghai-based outfit called Directive Games, founded just three years ago. Directive co-founder and CEO Atli Mar Sveinsson shared the spotlight at Apple's event in the newly christened Steve Jobs Theater, standing by a robot battle demo of the immersive characteristics of the new technologies and his game, The Machines. ""The fact that they have so many devices that support augmented reality from the get-go is amazing,"" Mr. Sveinsson said afterward. ""We're super excited to see how the market responds."" Lior Susan, founder and partner at Eclipse VC, a hardware-focused venture fund, said that Apple is making AR applications more viable thanks to its wide distribution and popular hardware. ""Some of the startups that are working in the space can finally go and pitch and show real use cases,"" he said. ""To date they had a hard time showing adoption."" w'"
31,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple's head of software and services is Eddy Cue. An earlier version of this article incorrectly spelled his name as Eddie Cue. (Sept. 12, 2017) Apple Inc. has signed new deals to sell movies in ultra high-definition with every major Hollywood studio except the one with which it has long been closest: Walt Disney Co. At an event Tuesday where he announced the new Apple TV 4K, the tech giant's head of software and services, Eddy Cue, said the device will offer Hollywood movies in the high-resolution format, called either 4K or UHD, for ultra-high definition. Logos for most major studios briefly flashed on a screen behind Mr. Cue, including Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. and Comcast Corp.'s Universal Pictures. Mr. Cue said those studios' movies will be available in UHD at the same price as high-definition movies. Participating studios have agreed to a maximum price of $19.99 for 4K movies, currently the highest price for HD movies, according to a person with knowledge of the deal making. Apple had pushed studios not to raise film prices above that threshold. An Apple spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The one absence from Apple's list of big studios selling movies in UHD is Disney. It wasn't immediately clear why the company behind Star Wars and Marvel couldn't reach an arrangement with Apple. It currently sells its films in 4K on other digital stores, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Vudu, for $24.99. A Disney spokesman declined to comment. Disney's absence is particularly notable given a longstanding close relationship between the two companies. Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger is on Apple's board of directors and Disney was the first studio to sell television shows and movies on iTunes. Some other Hollywood studios were concerned about the price for UHD movies being too low, which led to negotiations going down to the wire in recent weeks. Ultimately, however, all but Disney reached an accord with Apple. '"
32,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple Inc. introduced a trio of new iPhones Tuesday, making a bet that some customers will be willing to part with upward of $1,000 for the premium iPhone X while others will also pay up to upgrade regular models. Inside a theater at its new $5 billion headquarters, Apple Inc. worked to conjure the magic that 10 years ago made its iPhone the world's most valuable company's most valuable product. The pricing of the new flagship phone puts it closer to a major appliance or many PCs and represents a test of the enduring cachet of Apple products, already among the priciest in their field. The products are Apple's most anticipated in years. The company and its shareholders have endured a slump in iPhone sales growth and the company is facing intensifying competition from Samsung Electronics Co. and others. That anticipation has pushed Apple's share price up 39% this year to record highs, giving the company an unprecedented market value of more than $830 billion. The iPhone X boasts advanced features including facial-recognition capability and a 5.8-inch edge-to-edge, high-resolution screen. Apple also unveiled the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, featuring upgrades to last year's model with new design and features. IPhones contributed two thirds of Apple's $215.64 billion in revenue last fiscal year. Apple is trying to thread a needle, looking to generate buzz and sales with the iPhone X, which will cost from $999 to $1,149, while still getting people to buy the upgraded phones, which will start at $699 for the iPhone 8 and $799 for the iPhone 8 Plus. Unveiling three phones -- the first time Apple has done so -- brings risks with forecasting demand and managing production. In an early sign of the challenges, Apple said the iPhone X won't start shipping until Nov. 3 -- much later than usual. The two iPhone 8 models will be available for purchase on Sept. 22, in line with its regular timing for new iPhones. Apple didn't give a reason for the delay. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that production glitches in summer delayed the new phone's production schedule by a month and could lead to extended supply shortfalls. The iPhone X -- which also boasts depth sensors and a dual-lens camera system -- arrives amid questions about Apple's innovative strength. Rivals such as Samsung have matched or leapfrogged ahead of Apple's smartphone features, introducing larger displays using organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology and water resistance before Apple did. Meanwhile, rival smartphone makers in China are closing the gap offering similar features at far lower prices. That has contributed to slower sales growth: Apple's share of the global smartphone market slipped to 14.5% last year from 19.4% in 2012, according to Strategy Analytics, a market-research firm. Apple touted the iPhone X, which it pronounces ""iPhone Ten,"" as the future of the smartphone. ""It is the biggest leap forward since the first iPhone,"" said Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook. Some observers were skeptical. Holger Mueller, principal analyst at Constellation Research, said Apple failed to capitalize on the 10-year iPhone anniversary with a revolutionary new smartphone. ""Almost all innovations have been shown by the competition, notably Samsung,"" he said. Tuesday's event was choreographed to connect Apple more deeply with the mystique of its late co-founder Steve Jobs. It took place in a theater bearing his name at a new campus built based on his design concepts. It kicked off with a song by the Beatles, one of his favorite bands, and with audio of remarks he made about Apple's product philosophy. ""Steve's vision and passion live on here at Apple Park and everywhere at Apple,"" Mr. Cook said. Apple shares, which had been rising, slid slightly after the company announced the date of the iPhone X's availability, ending the day down 0.4%. Other companies have offered facial recognition, but Apple claimed its Face ID system is superior, blending artificial-intelligence with sensors that map faces in 3D using 30,000 invisible infrared dots. Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said Face ID can recognize faces in light and darkness, even if the user changes hairstyle or wears glasses or a hat. He said engineers worked to make sure photographs or masks can't trick it, and said the chances of someone other than the user unlocking the phone with Face ID are one in a million. That compares with one in 50,000 for Touch ID, the current fingerprint sensor technology that sits on a home button Apple is eliminating for the iPhone X. The iPhone X design has raised hopes that it can reverse Apple's fortunes in China, Apple's most important market outside the U.S., where sales have fallen six straight quarters. ""The high-end Chinese phone market is super competitive and customers are very discerning but also enthusiastic,"" said Benedict Evans, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital firm. ""If Apple can get something that rings the bell [with them], then this will work."" The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus feature what Apple has billed as a new design, made of glass on front and back, as well as louder speakers, faster processors and upgraded cameras. All three devices offer wireless charging and new gyroscopes and accelerometers to improve augmented reality experiences. Apple on Tuesday also announced a new Apple Watch with cellular connectivity, and an Apple TV with ultra-high definition functionality. Apple has sold an estimated 30 million Apple Watches since introducing the device in 2015, according to market research by IDC. The Apple Watch Series 3 has the potential to extend recent sales gains by boosting the device's functionality, analysts said. The update to Apple's streaming-media player, Apple TV 4K, is the first since 2015 and comes as the device has lost market share to lower-priced rivals. Apple Vice President Eddy Cue said Apple will sell ultra-high definition films from Hollywood studios at $19.99, the same price it currently offers high-definition films. There also will be live sports in 4K from ESPN and others. '"
33,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple Inc. on Tuesday accompanied its annual ritual of new product revelations with a different kind of unveiling, the first public look inside the Steve Jobs Theater on the technology giant's new campus. Apple welcomed nearly 1,000 guests to the glass-walled auditorium named after Apple's co-founder at the $5 billion Apple Park, which has been under construction for years. Work on the site reached a crescendo in recent months to ready it in time for the iPhone event, amping up anticipation for a product launch that is critical to Apple's future. This year's event featured a pricier new smartphone dubbed the iPhone X with advanced new features to mark the product's 10th anniversary, as well as two updated versions of last year's iPhone 7, a new version of the Apple Watch and other items. In recent years, Apple hosted its September event in rented venues around the Bay Area because it had outgrown its longtime headquarters nearby Apple Park. That drifting from its roots coincided with what some observers have called a period of relative stagnation in which Apple had no new breakthrough products, and made incremental changes to its cash-cow smartphone. Apple hopes that centralizing its teams on the campus will lead to closer collaboration -- and the iPhone event was the grand kickoff. ""We've been waiting for this for a long time,"" says Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies who attended the Tuesday event. ""Will [the campus] make a difference to how Wall Street sees Apple? Of course not, but there is excitement and the atmosphere will be different."" The Steve Jobs Theater is situated on a hill on the new campus, overlooking the main ring building that is designed to house Apple's core divisions. Outside, the smell of fertilizer mixed in with mulch permeated the air from the landscaping that has taken place this summer. From the exterior, the theater's metallic carbon-fiber roof appears to levitate over the 20-foot-tall glass cylinder. The stage, seating and other exhibit space where guests can play with Apple's new devices all are located underground. Steve Wozniak, who co-founded Apple with Mr. Jobs in the 1970s, was one of the guests Tuesday. His immediate reaction was, ""Wow, this is not normal,"" he said. He said the design reflected Steve Jobs's Apple, capturing his design instincts. Its primary use will be for product launches, said Dan Whisenhunt, Apple's head of real estate and development. It also will host seminar talks, small concerts and meetings led by Apple executives that can be simulcast everywhere on campus. The last two September events have taken place at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, a larger space that allowed Apple to invite 2,000 people, including school groups. While the smaller Steve Jobs Theater means cutting the guest list in half, ""this venue gets us back to the sweet spot,"" Mr. Whisenhunt said. '"

35,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Soon, all the cool kids will be smiling into their phones. When you pick up Apple Inc.'s new iPhone X, instead of unlocking with your thumb, you stop and grin at the phone's front unibrow as a bank of cameras and sensors check to see if it is really you. At a demo after Tuesday's launch event, I timed the process at about a second. People unlock their phones hundreds of times a day, so this selfie ritual will turn iPhone X owners into the most-photographed population ever. And showing off the move to others is probably the best iPhone sales pitch in years -- even if this one costs $1,000 or more. I saw little evidence in Apple's demo that the iPhone X can kick-start a new decadelong tech revolution. Its most practically useful features may be a bigger screen and (Apple claims) two additional hours of battery life. Yet the X moves the ball forward for our most-used gadgets, making cameras and visual tech central to the future of the smartphone. As usual, Apple giveth and Apple taketh away. Let this sink in: The iPhone X has no home button or fingerprint reader. Not even buried behind the screen. The culprit, Apple says, is the nearly all-screen front, which leaves no space for a button. It is a design tweak that changes how we relate to our phones. The new screen gives you even more usable screen area than the iPhone 7 Plus in a form that is only slightly larger than the iPhone 7. The new OLED tech used in the screen makes images look rich, and contributes to the significant improvement in battery life. In my hand, it feels like a big little phone -- perhaps a tad weighty. It is also a screen style we've seen in rival phones from Samsung Electronics Co., which managed to actually curve its Galaxy S8 screen to the edge on the left and right side. The iPhone X still has a metal rim all the way around that looks like a car bumper. Samsung has (temperamental) face and iris unlocking features, but it kept the fingerprint reader on the rear of the phone as a surefire backup. How well does the face-unlock thing work? That will require some serious testing. In my brief postevent demo, Apple wouldn't let me register my own face. At least once, it missed the face of the Apple product rep. (In dark situations, the phone sends out a beam of light as well as an array of invisible dots to read your face.) And the whole process was slowed by a clunky design: After the phone recognizes your face, you have to swipe up from the bottom of the phone to get to your home screen. In fact, there is a whole bunch of new finger yoga you will need to learn. To get to the control center, instead of swiping up from the bottom you now have to drag a finger from the top right corner. And since there is no home button, you swipe up from the bottom to get back to your home screen. It reminded me of Snapchat -- and like it, I could see some people just wanting to opt out of the confusion. The reward for changing your muscle memory is, beyond the face-unlocking trick, a new way to think about what you can do with a camera. Apple is now putting a lot of energy (and money) into opening up the world of augmented reality, which I agree has huge potential -- even if its current applications are more goofy than serious. The front-facing cameras, buried in the screen's funny notch, get the biggest boost. They include infrared sensors to map your face. You can take selfies with artfully blurred-out backgrounds. A new effect that Apple calls Portrait Lighting lets you create dramatic lighting on and around your subjects. One of the most compelling demos I saw placed my head, live, in fun contexts, including the Millennium Falcon from ""Star Wars."" In the feature that may best sum up 2017, you can turn your head into an animated singing and dancing emoji, called animoji. Yep, you can send your boo a personalized poo face. The two back cameras are also improved over the iPhone 7 Plus, though less dramatically. The second lens, used for 2X telephoto shots, now has optical image stabilization that should make portraits and zoomed-in shots less blurry. The cameras are also now oriented vertically, which Apple says will help with future augmented reality apps. I won't have all the answers until I review the phone, but here's my initial takeaway: With the iPhone X, Apple's best no longer looks like a three-year-old phone. (Apple's other new phone, the iPhone 8, still does.) The face-unlocking trick is a strategy to make you feel like you are missing out if you don't have an iPhone X.The jury's still out on its security and effectiveness, let alone those fancy new camera tricks and the vast future of augmented reality that has hit 11 on the buzz-o-meter. Nevertheless, the larger screen and improved battery life may be reason enough to satisfy even the more practically minded to contemplate an iPhone X. '"
36,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple Inc. is aiming to rejuvenate its signature smartphone with a trio of new handsets while sellers and suppliers hope the products revitalize the electronics supply chain. The company unveiled its new iPhone X, the WSJ's Tripp Mickle reports, in a highly anticipated rollout that Apple's backers hope will revive iPhone sales in China and trigger upgrades across the U.S. and Europe. Apple is trying to generate excitement with a phone packed with new features and a $999 price tag while selling versions at lower price points. Apple won't start shipping the iPhone X until Nov. 3, however, later than its usual shipments and perhaps the result of problems matching production to new technology. Despite the hoopla, the impact on Apple's suppliers is problematic, the WSJ's Jacky Wong reports, with many finding that investor interest lags once a new phone rolls out. The phones are shipping into a lackluster market: Research group Gartner says the global smartphone market grew 6.7% in the second quarter, boosted mostly by emerging markets, and that Apple's sales slipped 0.2%. U.S. southeast ports are returning to normal operations as recovery supply lines into Florida pick up speed and urgency. State utilities are going block by block, city by city, in one of the largest power restoration challenges in U.S. history, the WSJ's Cameron McWhirter, Erin Ailworth and Arian Campo-Flores report, as they bring back electricity to more than 15 million people following Hurricane Irma. France launched a massive airlift to bring supplies to St. Martin, the island that took a direct and devastating hit in the storm. In the U.S., more than 50,000 utility workers from the U.S. and Canada are descending on Florida and other states hit by the storm, part of a long stream of trucks joining returning residents on highways with loads of water, generators, food and construction materials. The region's ports started to reopen: Port Tampa Bay was expecting 10 crude tankers, South Carolina's Port of Charleston resumed operations with no reported damage and Georgia's Port of Savannah set today to handle nine waiting cargo ships. Washington is starting to move on self-driving vehicles. The Department of Transportation issued updated guidelines on regulating autonomous road technology, the WSJ's John D. McKinnon reports, even as Congress steps closer to writing legislation on self-driving trucks. The new federal guidelines follow a light touch the automotive technology industry wants so that it can develop and test new systems without having to meet cumbersome federal safety rules. The approach so far has allowed several states to work with companies advancing autonomous technology in trucking. A Colorado State Police officer tells a Senate panel in prepared testimony for a hearing today on autonomous trucks that ""it's time to begin planning in earnest for the deployment of semi- and fully-automated commercial motor vehicles."" The officer describes a state-supervised test in which a truck traveled 120 miles on Interstate 25 on autonomous technology before a driver took over for the final turns. The test highlights the potential, but also raises new questions for regulators, manufacturers and trucking companies. TRANSPORTATION The long slump for dry-bulk shipping companies may be ending. The Baltic Dry Index, the key measure for the cost of moving commodities like coal and iron ore, is hovering near its highest point in nearly three years, the WSJ's Costas Paris reports, and ship brokers say an improving global economy along with China's moves to limit its own production of industrial materials are fueling the upturn. That's welcome news to carriers that have sold and scrapped ships at heavy discounts to ride out a downturn that's devastated many fleets. The growth will likely continue because China's industrial limitations come even as the country steps up infrastructure spending, boosting demand for seaborne imports. Broader economic growth is also building up shipments of grain, lumber and other goods. The shipping rates are rising after years of downsizing that has left capacity relatively tight, but the stronger demand is sure to tempt carriers to bulk up fleets again. The market-share battle among smartphone makers is triggering changes in the expansive supply chains for the devices' smallest components. Japan's Murata Manufacturing Co. completed its roughly $160 million acquisition of Sony Corp.'s battery division, the WSJ's Takashi Mochizuki reports, a move likely to increase competition among the companies that power smartphones fromApple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Murata is already a big supplier of tiny parts to smartphone makers, with 24 factories shipping components. The company's move to get a bigger piece of the business is part an upheaval underway in the electronic-components world as the big manufacturers look for more power and longer life from the devices. The manufacturing scramble has helped boost airfreight volumes this year, and the competition for space inside the phones could restructure some factory supply chains. Murata faces competition in its drive for more battery business from Amperex Technology Ltd. and South Korea's LG Chem Ltd.

37,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'If you follow Apple, you know by now that the company just made its biggest phone announcement in years. There's the iPhone 8, a pretty update to the line that began with the iPhone 6 in 2014. Then there is the iPhone X, a major overhaul that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called ""the future of the smartphone."" Let's go over the major differences: 1) Phone Dimensions: Apple has had two sizes for a while, the standard phone with a 4.7-inch screen and the Plus model with the 5.5-inch screen. Both iPhone 8 models keep nearly the same screen sizes and overall dimensions as their predecessors, though they pack in a bit more weight. The iPhone X, with its spacious 5.8-inch screen, has a body that is only a tad larger than the standard iPhone, though substantially heavier. 2) Screen: The crown jewel of the iPhone X is its screen_x0014_a 5.8-inch display that uses OLED technology (similar to that on Samsung phones) rather than traditional LCD. It also packs in more pixels: 2436 by 1125, with a density of 458 pixels per inch. The LCD on the iPhone 8 Plus, like its phablet predecessors, has a pixel resolution of 1920 by 1080, at 401 pixels per inch. 3) Biometrics: The big design news of iPhone X is that there is no home button. Which means no Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Apple introduced its replacement, Face ID, which uses a front-facing camera array and infrared technology to capture a 3-D scan to determine whether the face belongs to the phone's owner or a stranger. The user looks at the phone, and it unlocks if it likes what it sees. Face ID can be used with Apple Pay and apps that are Touch ID compatible. The iPhone 8 still uses Touch ID. 4) Battery and Charging: Apple says the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have battery life comparable to their predecessors, while the iPhone X lasts up to two hours longer than the iPhone 7. (These metrics are always a bit fuzzy, which is why we test them ourselves during our review.) But both the iPhone X and the iPhone 8 models support fast charging via a USB-C power adapter. Apple says this will charge up to 50% of the battery in 30 minutes. Apple also introduced wireless charging, using the Qi open standard, with all the new models. This means that by resting on a compatible charging pad, the phone can replenish without plugging in. Apple says it will sell its own charging pad next year. 5) Camera(s): When Apple introduced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, only the larger model got the dual camera. This provided a 2X telephoto lens and the ability to pull off tricks like Portrait Mode, which artfully blurs the background of a close-up shot. The same thing happened with the iPhone 8 models; while both get new sensors, only the iPhone 8 Plus has a dual camera. And like before, only one of the iPhone 8 Plus's cameras has optical image stabilization. The iPhone X has a redesigned dual camera??this time both have optical image stabilization. For the two new dual-camera models, there is a new beta feature called Portrait Lighting, which can change the lighting effects around and on the face of a photo's subject. 6) Price and Availability: These may be the biggest differentiators for some. The iPhone 8 starts at $699,'"
38,Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Only Apple Inc. gets to decide what to charge for its new iPhone, but investors will get to decide what the new flagship is worth. That could be a trillion-dollar question. The market value of the world's most valuable company already has surged 35% this year, to around $820 billion, ahead of Apple's expected introduction of the new iPhones on Tuesday. That means the stock needs to gain a further 22% -- to about $193.70 -- to get Apple's market value to the $1 trillion mark. And, while its heavy dependence on the iPhone has made Apple's stock rather cyclical over the past five years, the price tends to go up instead of down in the months that follow a launch of new devices. The comparison that most readily springs to mind is the iPhone 6. Apple's stock price had jumped nearly 30% over the previous six months by the time that version was introduced on Sept. 9, 2014. A larger screen kicked off a strong upgrade cycle that drove iPhone unit sales up 37% for the subsequent fiscal year and the stock up 30% over the next six months. But there are no guarantees of a repeat performance. Apple is expected to introduce three new phones. Two are believed to be incremental updates to the iPhone 7, while another is expected to be a redesigned phone with a curved display similar to this year's Galaxy lineup from Samsung. Production issues with the new design could push the launch of that model later into the year. Apple also is expected to charge a much higher price for the new phone -- possibly $1,000 or higher. That would help offset soaring prices for key components such as memory and displays. It also could crimp demand. Tuesday's presentation will help investors better assess the new phone's potential. Analysts already expect the bulk of the new iPhone cycle to show up in Apple's results for the next fiscal year, which begins in October. Total revenue is expected to hit a record $261 billion in fiscal 2018, with a 13% jump in iPhone unit sales expected. Apple's per-share earnings for the year are expected to be $10.82 -- 20% higher than Wall Street's forecast for the current fiscal year. Apple's stock currently trades at about 14.7 times 2018's projected earnings, which is already on the high side of its five-year range. A market cap of $1 trillion would represent nearly 18 times forward earnings based on current estimates, which is well above the stock's peak multiple. Apple remains the cheapest of its Big Tech peers -- especially when accounting for its $165 billion of net cash -- so a strong iPhone cycle could give the stock some additional upside. But investors should be aware that much has already been dialed in. '"
39,Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'It's that time of year again. Apple will unveil its newest iPhones, Apple Watch and Apple TV at its new headquarters in Cupertino today. Techies will be keeping an eye on things like iPhone screen sizes and 4k resolution for the Apple TV, but marketing and media types will be more interested in any software advances they might be able to take advantage of. Some marketers are already excited by Apple's push into augmented reality technology, for example, which the company may show off on stage later today. For The Sports Haters Bloomberg reported this spring that certain media companies were in talks to offer a bundle of non-sports TV channels. Well, things have advanced considerably, so get ready. Wall Street Journal media editor Amol Sharma reports that a non-sports streaming service is set to have a ""soft launch"" in coming weeks. For under $20 a month, it will offer channels from Discovery Communications, Viacom, Scripps, AMC Networks and A+E Networks, sources tell him. The service, which will be powered by a company called Philo that used to specialize in streaming TV services for college campuses, will also be branded as ""Philo."" This is about targeting people who are tired of paying for pricey sports networks they don't watch. But it's also defensive: Some of these channels are being left out of skinny web TV bundles, so joining forces makes sense. Ad Spend Slowdown Ad buying agencies Zenith and GroupM have both lowered their expectations for global ad spending in 2017 and 2018, citing a range of factors including political uncertainty, slowing economic growth in China and a slowdown in spending in major categories such as consumer packaged goods, CMO today reports. WPP's GroupM said it's expecting 3% global ad growth in 2017, down from 4.4% it had predicted in December. Meanwhile, Publicis Groupe's Zenith said it now expects global spending to grow 4% this year, down from the estimate of 4.2% it had made in June. That's not good news for agencies, which typically get paid more when their clients spend more money. What's more, agencies are struggling to maintain leverage with major digital platforms such as Facebook, Amazon and Google, whose businesses continue to grow at a much faster rate than 4% a year. Keeping comScore More drama over at comScore. The digital media measurement firm said Monday that most of its board members will resign and that it will complete a ""strategic review"" of its business following shareholder criticisms about a lack of transparency around its finances, WSJ reports. The company has been dogged by accounting problems over the past year and said it needs more time to file its restated financials. Meanwhile, competition in the online measurement space is heating up. While comScore attempts to compete with measurement giant Nielsen, new rivals are emerging. Oracle acquired fast-growing media measurement firm Moat earlier this year, for example, while other independent measurement vendors race to strike partnerships with major online platforms such as Facebook and Snapchat. Trust Fall People now access and consume large amounts of news content via social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, but that doesn't mean they trust the information they find there, according to the Pew Research Center. A new survey by the nonpartisan research body found that just 3% of respondents trust the information they find on social media services ""a lot,"" compared with national news organizations at 17% and government sources at 18%. Of course, much of the content surfaced through platforms such as Facebook is, in fact, created by news outlets, but recent concerns around the spread of fake news across social platforms could lead readers to be more skeptical of the content and information they find there. Information from health-care providers and local public libraries fared better at 39% and 40%, respectively, although we don't recommend relying on your physician for hurricane updates. Best of the rest: Some are calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to answer tough questions about the company's ability to influence the political process, following its disclosure last week that Russian-backed ads appeared on Facebook during last year's election. [The Intercept, Quartz] Highly-anticipated TV ratings from Nielsen for Sunday night's NFL game have been delayed, after the measurement company was forced to evacuate staff in its Tampa Bay, Fla., office due to Hurricane Irma. [Reuters] Facebook launched a new ad format designed to replicate the look of a print catalog, which will allow customers to purchase items from directly within the ad.

40,Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'It's the $1 trillion question in markets: Will Apple's latest iPhone, due to be unveiled later Tuesday, be another hit? No matter the answer, investors might be wise to cool their bets on some of the U.S. tech giant's Asian suppliers: History suggests they don't do so well once the razzmatazz has passed. On average, iPhone suppliers have outperformed the market by 7.2% in the six months before a launch, only to underperform by 3.9% in the three months after, according to brokerage firm Bernstein. Prelaunch excitement has certainly fueled the likes of Hong Kong-listed AAC Technologies, an iPhone-speaker supplier whose share price is up 46% in the past three months??even though analysts over that period have raised their earnings estimates for next year by only 9%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Around half of AAC's revenue comes from Apple, according to Bernstein. The shares of Taiwan-listed lens maker Largan and Shenzhen-listed microphone supplier Goertek, both with AAC-levels of exposure to Apple, have also run significantly ahead of earnings expectations recently. A better iPhone bet may be component makers that take a smaller bite from Apple, but are riding the latest trends in smartphones. Take Sony, a supplier of iPhone image sensors: It gets less than 5% of its revenue from Apple, but should benefit from the continuing shift toward dual lenses in smartphone cameras. Similarly, Samsung Electronics, a leader in both memory '"
41,Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Want to annoy Apple fanatics? Remind them how many magical iPhone capabilities arrived first on Android. Big screens? Fingerprint scanners? Mobile payments? Water resistance? None of it invented in Cupertino. Ahead of Apple's wildly hyped 10th-anniversary iPhone launch on Tuesday, three more Android phones have been pushing the boundaries of what smartphones look like and how we use them: Samsung's Galaxy Note 8, the Essential Phone and the OnePlus 5. Screens are taking over. By nipping and tucking around the glass, designers have made screens longer, with more usable area. And the best screens make images look more lifelike and colorful with a tech called OLED. Using the Note 8, which arrives Sept. 15, is the closest I've come to manipulating a sci-fi movie communicator-gizmo -- 6.3 inches of screen, nearly without edges. It's a big part of what makes the Note 8 the best big-screen phone money can buy. The $700 Essential phone, from a startup founded by Android's creator, wraps a 5.7-inch screen in a slim belt of titanium. It's the handsomest phone I've seen in years though it disappoints in other areas. These designs are changing how we operate the phone. With no space on the front for a home button and fingerprint reader, unlocking has to happen elsewhere. Essential moved the fingerprint sensor to the back. Samsung did, too, but you can also unlock the Note 8 with facial recognition or an iris scan -- when they work. Cameras are the other big news. Now the best phones have two lenses on the back, using the extra eye for closer-in zoom shots and even depth perception. Dual cameras are no longer a bank-breaking feature. Of course, it isn't about getting features first: What matters is who does it best. If you're looking for an Android phone to buy now, or you're just keeping score, here's what I like -- and don't -- about the leading contenders. Galaxy Note 8 This giant phone can chew gum and hula hoop at the same time. Likes: If you're abandoning your laptop for a smartphone, stop here first. The Note 8's screen, about as big as an XL Hershey bar, is a no-longer-crazy way for road warriors to rock Gmail and spreadsheets simultaneously. With the included stylus, which tucks inside the screen, scribbling notes is almost as easy as using paper. The Note 8 stuffs in pretty much every feature somebody might want from a phone in 2017: virtual-reality capability, widely accepted mobile payments, wireless charging, an animated GIF maker -- it can even become a desktop computer with a $150 dock. And like other recent Samsung phones, it's water-resistant and allows you to add your own memory card for storage. The Note 8 camera not only joins the multilens trend but jumps to its forefront. In my tests, the Note 8 often outperformed the iPhone 7 Plus at focusing quickly and snapping low-light situations, though I still prefer many shots from Google's Pixel. Zoomed-in shots from the 2X telephoto lens were clear thanks to optical image stabilization. The ""live focus"" mode that uses depth data to artfully blur portraits had some hiccups, but no more than the iPhone 7 Plus's similar ""portrait mode."" Dislikes: All that screen gobbles up battery, which lasted a ho-hum eight hours in my stress test. The fingerprint reader is poorly placed, while the facial recognition isn't fast or reliable enough. Bixby, Samsung's Siri competitor, still feels underdeveloped, though Google's Assistant is also available. I find the Note 8 too much phone to carry comfortably. A more slender alternative is Samsung's Galaxy S8, though photo buffs would miss the dual cameras. Essential Phone This attractive new model is better off in front of the camera than behind it. Likes: The Essential has the first phone design in a while that can actually turn heads. The screen comes so close to the edge, there's a notch cut out for the front-facing camera. The ceramic back cover feels luxe and promises to last longer than other phones' scratch-prone finishes. The software is just as clean: basic Android, no bloatware. And the battery lasted a decent nine hours in my stress test. Essential has an interesting approach to accessories: They can snap on and draw power from the phone. But so far, there's only one, a 360-degree camera -- and modular-phone efforts by LG and Motorola haven't caught on. Dislikes: The Essential Phone doesn't actually cover the essentials. There's no headphone jack (it includes an adapter, but no headphones) and it isn't water-resistant. The biggest problem is the camera: It's slow and struggles in low-light settings. Another disappointment: The second lens on the back is for black-and-white shots, not zoom. OnePlus 5 It's a remarkable value, but it looks like last year's phone. Likes: The OnePlus 5 is slim and lightweight yet packs in performance: smooth-running software, bright OLED screen and a battery that lasted a solid 9.5 hours in my tests. The dual camera also wowed, though Samsung and Apple beat it with their fancy-blur portrait mode. What's most incredible, though, is the price: $480, sold through the OnePlus website without the typical carrier hoopla, contracts and bloatware. In a year when premium phones aim to break the $1,000 ceiling, the OnePlus 5 is a welcome option. Dislikes: The thick-bordered screen looks like phones we've seen before. (Upside: There's still space for a fingerprint reader on the front.) The screen also isn't as high-resolution as the Note 8's, nor does the phone have tricks like face unlocking or wireless charging. If you want to double the default 64GB storage, the price rises to $539. '"
42,Mon Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Apple Inc. is gearing up for a big push to popularize augmented reality, launching new hardware and software in the coming weeks that make it easier for users to shop for virtual couches, slay digital zombies and drop artificial videos into their living rooms. A new high-end iPhone is expected to be unveiled Tuesday with a dual-lens camera system and 3-D sensors that improve depth-sensing and enhance augmented-reality experiences. Apple's new operating system, iOS 11, which becomes available this fall, will offer new augmented-reality capabilities first previewed in June. Meanwhile, apps that impose virtual images on real scenes are expected to flood the company's App Store, as companies ranging from IKEA to AMC Networks Inc. hope to benefit from Apple's promotion of augmented reality. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has touted augmented reality, telling analysts last month: ""This is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it."" Katy Huberty, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said Apple sees the addition of augmented reality -- which combines the virtual and the real on a smartphone screen or other device -- as potentially as transformational for its business as the App Store's debut in 2008. If the technology takes off, she said, it could help reinvigorate flagging iPhone sales. It also could ease questions about Apple's continuing ability to innovate. The hope among some augmented-reality enthusiasts is that Apple will popularize the technology, triggering consumer trial and adoption. Some proponents, though, are skeptical about the technology's immediate potential. Matt Miesnieks, a partner at Super Ventures, an investment firm that targets augmented-reality startups, expects most early apps in the field will become seldom-used novelties. He said features enabled by Apple's augmented-reality development platform, ARKit, are limited and it is awkward for people to hold handsets in front of their faces to commingle real and digital worlds. Mr. Miesnieks doesn't see apps gaining traction until late next year, when he expects an updated ARKit with more capabilities. Augmented reality shot to prominence last year following the release of ""Pokemon Go,"" a game in which players scoured the real world, with the help of location-tracking technology, to find digital monsters superimposed through the smartphone screen. But public enthusiasm soon faded. Still, tech companies including Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Facebook Inc., and Snap Inc. are vying with Apple to drive augmented reality forward. Google recently announced its own augmented-reality software system, ARCore, to compete with Apple's system. ARKit, which Apple released in June, eliminates obstacles for developing augmented-reality apps, offering software capable of tasks like tracking a user's position and estimating the light available in a room. It also turned an estimated 500 million iPhone owners into potential customers. Using ARKit, Touch Press Inc. was able to build an augmented-reality world based on the children's book ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" in about six weeks, a quick turnaround that surprised the company because previous augmented-reality projects performed inconsistently, said Chief Executive Barry O'Neill. Apple declined to comment. '"
43,Mon Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'A decade into the smartphone era, Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. are betting they can increase sales by jacking up the price of their flagship products -- bucking the usual downward arc for prices of consumer electronics in the years after introduction. Apple on Tuesday is expected to unveil a more-advanced iPhone -- also known as the anniversary iPhone, the iPhone 8 or iPhone X -- which analysts predict will carry a starting retail price of about $1,000. That would be about 50% more than the cheapest version of the iPhone 7 Apple introduced last year at $649, and about 30% more than the larger iPhone 7 Plus, at $769. (On Tuesday, Apple also is expected to show off updated versions of those phones with prices similar to last year's models.) Apple's new iPhone debut follows Samsung's launch last month of its new high-end phone, the Galaxy Note 8, which hits shelves Sept. 15 starting at around $950. Prices approaching $1,000 are more often associated with durable kitchen appliances than with pocket-size devices people tend to replace every few years. Yet Apple and Samsung think they will be able to sell tens of millions of smartphones at the higher price points, in part because of how vital the devices have become. Many users are willing to pay a premium for a handset that functions as not only a mobile phone, but also a personal computer, a video player, a gaming device, a GPS system, a music player, a reader, a flashlight and a wallet. U.S. consumers now spend more than three hours a day on average on their mobile devices, according to research firm eMarketer. Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy, said people are postponing upgrades to their other gadgets so they have more to spend on their smartphones. ""The utility value of these products is so, so high,"" said Horace Dediu, an industry analyst at Asymco and a former Nokia Corp. business development executive. The companies believe their prices are justified to pay for innovations such as longer battery life, larger displays and voice assistants. Apple's newest iPhone is expected to have components that cost about 80% more than the components in the iPhone 7, including an edge-to-edge, organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, display, wireless charging and new sensors, according to brokerage firm Susquehanna International Group. If consumers take the new price points in stride, Apple and Samsung could widen their advantage over hundreds of smartphone rivals, many struggling to break even. Apple and Samsung claim nearly all the industry's combined annual profits, with about 79% for Apple and 15% for Samsung, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics. The two are defying the gravity that usually pulls consumer prices downward as innovation wanes and manufacturing costs fall. Average smartphone prices have fallen 32% to $303 in the decade since the iPhone's introduction. The average iPhone selling price rose about 2.5% to $645 in Apple's fiscal 2016, up from $629 in fiscal 2009. Last year's pricier iPhone 7 Plus with a dual-lens camera outsold its predecessor, the iPhone 6s Plus -- a sign consumers are willing to pay up for performance. Samsung had to pull the Galaxy Note 7 from shelves last year due to overheating batteries, but the Galaxy S7 model went on to become its top-selling phone ever. Unlike Apple, Samsung, the world's largest phone maker by shipments, also sells hundreds of millions of lower-cost handsets. New features on Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 include a dual-lens camera and a mammoth 6.3-inch OLED screen. The Note 8's component costs rose about 20% over the prior year, according to an estimate by IHS Markit, a market researcher. Many consumers are balking at a $1,000 handset. A recent survey of wireless consumers by Barclay's found only 11% of respondents would spend more than $1,000 on a smartphone, with respondents on average saying they would spend only about $580. Apple and Samsung have financing plans that can obscure the full cost of new phones. Apple's upgrade program last year offered the iPhone 7 for $32 a month over 24 months -- about $120 more than the retail price but with an extended warranty and the option for an upgrade after a year.

44,Mon Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Apple Inc. on Tuesday will hold its most important product event in years, unveiling the newest iPhones, Apple Watch and Apple TV at its new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. Investors and consumers around the world will tune in to see the latest features. Here's what you need to know: Apple does this every September, so what's the big deal? This event offers up several firsts. On the product side, it marks the first time Apple will unveil three iPhones at its fall showcase. One will be a high-end model with new display and sensors that will be called the iPhone X, according to reports on a recent Apple software leak. The other two will be upgrades to last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple declined to comment for this article. It also will be the inaugural event at Apple's new, $5 billion campus. The event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater, a 1,000-seat auditorium inside a cylindrical, glass building. The theater is situated on a hill overlooking the company's new headquarters, designed to resemble a spaceship. What's the deal with the three new iPhones? Most of the focus will be on the high-end iPhone. Though Apple has guarded its plans with its usual secrecy ahead of the announcement, analysts have a good sense of what features will be included. The phone is expected to be Apple's first with an organic light-emitting diode, OLED, display, which will be larger, at 5.8 inches, and sharper than previous, LCD displays. Apple ditched the home button in the phone, which is expected to be unlocked through facial-recognition technology. The phone is expected to offer wireless charging and 3D sensors that enhance the performance of forthcoming augmented-reality apps. The upgraded iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are expected to have longer battery life and faster processors. How much will the high-end iPhone cost? The new iPhone is expected to cost about $1,000, making it about 50% more expensive than the cheapest version of the iPhone 7 introduced last year. The price reflects an estimated 80% increase in the component costs for the device. The new display costs more than double the price of the LCD display Apple has used in the past, according to analysts. Add a new 3D sensor, a pricier battery and greater memory, and analysts say the phone more than justifies a much higher price tag. What will investors be scrutinizing? Few other big companies' fortunes are as tied to a single product line as Apple's are to the iPhone, which accounted for two-thirds of its $215.64 billion in sales last fiscal year. In addition to gauging whether new features will be attractive enough to drive sales, investors will be watching price, dates and availability of the new iPhone. If it is priced around $1,000, it could lift the average-selling price of iPhones and boost Apple revenue_x0014_if enough consumers buy it. Investors will be looking for Apple to announce that the new iPhone will be available Sept. 22. They also will be eyeing total number of markets where it will be sold, hoping that sheds some light on iPhone supplies. The phone ran into production issues over the summer that raised concerns about a shortfall. Delaying the date or limiting the number of markets where it is available could signal production issues, says Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. Apple offered the iPhone 7 in 29 markets and its predecessor, the iPhone 6s, in 12 markets. What about other products? The Apple Watch is due for a big upgrade. Apple is planning to introduce one this year capable of connecting to cellular networks, potentially enabling it to get messages and other data independent of the iPhone. The LTE capabilities in the device would be a step forward in its evolution, and Apple's effort to free it from its dependency on the iPhone. The Apple TV is also set for an update. The company is expected to announce a new streaming-media player with 4K capabilities that allows it to offer significantly sharper video than its previous models. Apple has been scrambling to strike deals with Holly""ood studios so it can offer ultra-high definition films on the new player. Will there be any surprises? Apple always plans some sort of surprise. Last year, it was the announcement that Nintendo Co. would create its first game for the iPhone, ""Super Mario Run."" Some guesses for this ye'"
45,Mon Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Investors will focus this week on the biggest U.S. company by market capitalization. Apple Inc. is expected to roll out three new iterations of its popular iPhone on Tuesday, including a larger and more expensive 10th anniversary showcase edition and updates to its two iPhone 7 models that started selling last year. Excitement for the unveiling has grown all year among investors. The stock is up 37% in 2017, nearly four times the gain of the broader S&P 500 index. The stock has gained 21% on average in the six months leading up to past iPhone launches. But history suggests that the momentum is likely to fade after Tuesday. In the week after a new launch, Apple shares have averaged a 1.6% fall, according to The Wall Street Journal's Market Data Group. September, when Apple has rolled out new iPhones in recent years, is a historically tough month for Apple's stock. It has averaged a 4.2% drop during the 36 Septembers since it went public, according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. The Such performance matters for investors in more than just Apple. The company, valued at $819 billion, makes up 3.9% of the market value of the S&P 500, the highest of any of the index's companies. A disappointing launch could be drag on major U.S. stock indexes during an already-volatile month. The S&P 500 is down slightly in September as investors fret about a range of issues from North Korea to soft inflation readings to hurricanes. Apple has tended to rebound pretty quickly from a post-iPhone launch slump. A month after the release, shares gain 1.3% on average, and six months later they are up almost 14%. '"

47,Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Walt Disney Co. intends to offer its Marvel and Star Wars properties through the subscription video service it is planning to launch in 2019, rather than renewing a deal with Netflix Inc., according to Chief Executive Robert Iger. Disney announced last month it would launch its own on-demand service in late 2019, on which it would offer animated and live-action family films that currently stream on Netflix after they run in theaters and are sold on DVD and in digital stores such as Apple Inc.'s iTunes. However, Mr. Iger said at the time Disney wasn't certain if the company would include Marvel and Star Wars movies on its own service or it would continue to license them to Netflix. In deciding to retain the rights to two of its biggest franchises, including superhero movies like ""Avengers"" and the ""Star Wars"" sequels and spinoffs, Disney is giving up tens of millions of dollars per movie it currently receives from Netflix. However, it will bolster the amount of premium content available on its own digital service and thus, Mr. Iger is betting, its appeal to consumers. ""We're going to launch big and we're going to launch hot,"" Mr. Iger said of the digital service, speaking at a media-business conference on Thursday. For Netflix, Disney's decision will add to the pressure for it to create appealing original content of its own in order to replace some of the high-profile franchise films it will lose starting in 2019. A Netflix spokesman declined to comment. In addition to all of the movies Disney produces for theaters, typically around 10 a year, the company will produce four or five lower-budget movies exclusively for its new digital service, Mr. Iger said at the investor conference organized by Bank of America Corp. It will also make four or five original series and three or four ""television movies"" of the type that currently run on its Disney Channel, Mr. Iger added. The service will launch in the U.S. in late 2019 as movies that previously would have been on Netflix become available, Mr. Iger said, though it could launch earlier in other countries. '"
48,Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple Inc.'s new iPhone, which is expected to be unveiled Tuesday, was plagued by production glitches this summer, according to people familiar with the situation, which could result in extended supply shortfalls when customers start ordering the device later this month. New iPhones typically are in short supply when first released. But if shortages of the new phone extend beyond the initial sales period, which is expected to begin Sept. 22, analysts and investors could dial back their projections for sales in the crucial holiday period. The glitches, which occurred early in the manufacturing process, set back the phone's production timetable by about a month. Foxconn Technology Group, the Apple contractor that assembles iPhones, has been ramping up production at its complex in Zhengzhou, China. The company is paying bonuses to employees who can help bring new hires on board at its Zhengzhou plant, which Foxconn said in June employs about 250,000 people. Apple and Foxconn declined to comment. There are big expectations for the new iPhone, informally dubbed the iPhone 8 or iPhone X by industry watchers. Investors, betting the new phone will rejuvenate Apple's sales after a recent slump, have pushed Apple's share price to record highs in recent months. The new device is expected to have a base price near $1,000 -- a significant premium over existing models -- in part because of more expensive components. Analysts' forecasts for initial shipments vary widely, with some projecting as many as five million units shipped in the last week or so of September. Complicating demand estimates for the new phone, Apple is also expected to release updates to its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The company said last month that it expects total revenue of $49 billion to $52 billion for the quarter ending Sept. 30, figures that exceeded some analysts' estimates. The production delays earlier this summer stemmed in part from Apple's decision to build new phones using organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screens similar to those used by rival Samsung Electronics Co. At the same time, Apple decided to ditch the physical home button that contains fingerprint sensors for unlocking the device. Apple tried to embed the Touch ID function, or fingerprint scanner, in the new display, which proved difficult, the people familiar with the process said. As deadlines approached, Apple eventually abandoned the fingerprint scanner, the people said, and users will unlock the phone using either an old-fashioned password or what is expected to be a new facial-recognition feature. Nonetheless, precious time was lost and production was put back by about a month, according to people familiar with the situation. Apple and its suppliers also ran into trouble manufacturing the OLED displays. The display modules are being produced in Vietnam by an affiliate of Samsung Electronics. Unlike the OLED display module in Samsung's own smartphones, in which the display and touch panel are integrated, iPhone's display module has the touch panel outside of the display, said a person familiar with the technology. The iPhone manufacturing process requires more steps and more layers of adhesive and protective film than are involved in Samsung's manufacturing process, the person familiar with the process said, creating a greater risk of manufacturing error. A spokesman at Samsung Display, which operates the Vietnam affiliate, declined to comment. Apple often has faced supply shortfalls with new iPhones released since 2008. The last time Apple changed the iPhone's appearance was in 2014 -- and Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., struggled then with low output because of display manufacturing issues.

49,Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple has at last broken its silence on net neutrality. Last week the company sent a letter to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission endorsing ""strong, enforceable open internet protections"" and opposing the FCC's planned deregulation. ""Consumers must be allowed to access the lawful internet content, applications, and services of their choice,"" wrote Cynthia C. Hogan, Apple's vice president of public policy for the Americas. ""Broadband providers should not block, throttle, or otherwise discriminate against lawful websites and services."" Apple's comments are directly in line with the larger progressive narrative, which presents net neutrality as a bulwark against corporate censorship. If the FCC's deregulation went through, a senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union worried in July, ""corporations like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T will have the power to distort the flow of data and the marketplace of ideas online."" Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg wrote that the FCC plan would let internet providers ""block you from seeing certain content."" A public policy manager at Twitter said ""free expression"" would be threatened because cable companies could ""block content they don't like."" One problem: No one has presented a single credible case of any major internet provider censoring web content based on political beliefs. But you know who does? The very companies calling for net neutrality. Apple, Facebook, Google, PayPal, Twitter and other tech firms are engaged in increasingly strict political censorship through vague and subjective prohibitions on ""hate speech"" and ""fake news."" Twitter outright banned the conservative provocateurs Milo Yiannopoulos and Anthony Cumia. Although these men could be caustic online -- Mr. Yiannopoulos has embraced the label ""troll"" -- social-media companies also blocked controversial but sober political arguments. Twitter allows paying users to ""promote"" their tweets, but last month it refused posts from the Center for Immigration Studies, including one that argued ""illegal immigrants are a large net fiscal drain."" Facebook reportedly removed a post last year that merely argued ""what Trump is trying to say is that Homeland Security can not differentiate which muslim is radical wanting to cause harm and which is a harmless refugee."" Google's YouTube restricted access last year to dozens of videos from PragerU, a project of conservative talk-radio host Dennis Prager, including lectures by prominent experts on subjects such as ""Israel: The World's Most Moral Army."" PayPal canceled service this summer to dozens of accounts labeled as ""hate groups"" by the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center. Apple Pay soon followed suit, and CEO Tim Cook announced his company would donate $1 million each to the SPLC and the Anti-Defamation League. Proponents of net neutrality say this comparison is apples and oranges. Since most people have only one or two options for high-speed internet, and because cable companies must invest billions of dollars in infrastructure, the argument is that competition won't effectively check censorship. On the other hand, we're told to think of ""platform monopolies"" like Facebook as competing newspapers that would be beaten in the marketplace if they began to censor. But this ignores that social media is the textbook example of a service with ""network effects."" The more users they have, the more valuable they become. The point of social media is communicating with others on social media. You could start a free-speech competitor to Facebook or Twitter, but it wouldn't provide remotely the same service until it attracted hundreds of millions of users. Moreover, social media companies present themselves as open forums. ""Free expression is part of our company DNA,"" the Twitter public-policy manager wrote in July. ""We are the platform that lets users see what's happening and to see all sides."" The Supreme Court apparently agrees. In Packingham v. North Carolina, an opinion issued in June, the justices described social media as the ""modern public square."" For years, Facebook denied it was a media company in any sense of the term. Then in December, when it began restricting fake news, Mr. Zuckerberg claimed it was ""not a traditional media company."" The legal difference here is important. Traditional media companies like newspapers can be held liable for the content they publish. But online platforms are given a safe harbor under law to avoid liability for their users' content. The statute setting up this immunity explicitly states that Congress believes ""the Internet and other interactive computer services offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse."" This isn't to say that social-media companies should be subject to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or ""common carrier"" regulations, as some have recently begun to advocate. But if Apple, Facebook and Google want to prevent big corporations from suppressing free speech online, then: physician, heal thyself. '"
50,Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Take two of the hottest themes in the market, electric vehicles and new iPhones, and both lead you to a Korean tech company: Samsung SDI. The $11 billion company, 20% owned by Samsung Electronics, makes most of its revenue from batteries, yet the biggest profit driver in the next few years will come from something else, smartphone screens. The company has a 15% stake in Samsung Display, which makes screens for smartphones and televisions. Samsung Electronics owns the remaining 85%. Apple is widely expected to unveil three iPhones next Tuesday, with the priciest one featuring an edge-to-edge screen using a technology called organic light-emitting diodes. Samsungowns nearly the whole mobile OLED market, which means it will almost certainly be the sole supplier to Apple. OLED screens give sharper images and use less power. Their curved edges allow bigger screen sizes without making the phones bulkier. SDI's stake in Samsung Display gives investors a way to benefit from rising demand for the screens. Samsung Display contributed around $200 million to SDI's profits last quarter, similar to what its contribution was for all of 2016. While many top-end Android smartphones, for example Samsung's latest flagship Galaxy S8, already sport OLED screens, Apple's joining the fray would make that more of a ""must-have"" for future phones. Brokerage firm Bernstein forecasts $1.5 billion in income contribution from the display unit for SDI next year, six times last year's level. While there is looming competition, Goldman Sachs expects that 80% of Apple's OLED screens will still come from Samsung in 2019, even if all iPhones produced beginning next year are using the technology. Apart from its stake in Samsung Display, SDI also supplies materials for making OLED screens. The bigger worry for investors is SDI's core battery business??it barely made any profit last quarter. But things are looking up, even there. Smartphone batteries started making profits again last quarter after losses caused by last year's recall of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. The car-battery business may continue to lose money, but strong sales of electric vehicles in Europe could give a surprising lift. The BMW i3, of which SDI is a supplier, is selling well. SDI also supplies to Volkswagen's new e-Golf. That could help SDI to erase its pains in China, where the government denied certifications for its batteries last year. The protectionist move means electric cars in China that use SDI's batteries may not be eligible f'"

Foxconn, the Taiwan-based iPhone assembler formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is offering more than 2 trillion yen ($18.4 billion) for Toshiba's flash-memory unit, people directly involved in the discussions said. That is slightly higher than the two rival bids, one from a group that includes U.S.-based Western Digital Corp. and another from a group that includes private-equity firm Bain Capital, they said. Foxconn's package could include support from business partners from the U.S. and Japan, including Apple Inc. and SoftBank Group Corp., the people said. Apple declined to comment. SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son, who has called Foxconn leader Terry Gou ""a true, close friend,"" said recently that he is open to discussing how he might help on a Toshiba deal. Inside Toshiba, the Foxconn consortium is getting a vocal boost from some board members, people involved in the discussions said. These board members say that Toshiba would be better off keeping the chip unit, because it is the conglomerate's biggest profit maker, but they argue that if it must be sold, Toshiba needs to get a maximum price so its remaining parts can survive. The Japanese conglomerate is struggling to stay afloat after its nuclear subsidiary Westinghouse Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy in March. Toshiba's liabilities exceeded assets by nearly $5 billion as of June 30. Foxconn's boosters say that its bid would be more likely to receive antitrust clearance because the Foxconn-led consortium doesn't include any memory-chip makers. They also say that the Taiwanese company's broad connections in the technology world could help Toshiba's unit sell more chips and compete with memory-chip leader Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea. Still, Foxconn remains an underdog, people involved in the decision said. Japanese government officials have long expressed concern that if Foxconn wins, Toshiba's technology could leak to China because of Foxconn's extensive operations in China. People on Foxconn's side say it would preserve employees and technology in Japan. The Japanese government is pushing Toshiba's board to accept the Western Digital group's bid, the people said. Western Digital, a hard-disk-drive maker, jointly operates Toshiba's Japan-based memory business and has threatened to block any deal it doesn't like, using an international arbitration process and other legal steps. Representatives of Toshiba, Western Digital, Foxconn and Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry declined to comment about the status of the discussions. Government officials have said they would like to see Toshiba's problems resolved quickly, in part so the company can focus on decontamination work at nuclear reactors in Fukushima that suffered meltdowns in 2011. A deal with anyone other than Western Digital would face a higher risk of getting undone later because of the U.S. company's stance that it can block any rival bidder. But Western Digital faces strong internal opposition at Toshiba's memory unit because of the rancor over the sale. Senior people at the unit have threatened to quit en masse and bring top engineers with them if Western Digital wins the race, according to people who have heard the threats. The Western Digital consortium includes private-equity firm KKR & Co., while Bain Capital's group has teamed up with South Korean chip maker SK Hynix Inc. Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a fund backed by the Japanese government, and 100%-government-owned Development Bank of Japan have expressed willingness to join either of those two groups -- but not Foxconn's -- so Japanese entities can keep majority control of the Toshiba unit and ensure technology doesn't leak overseas. To ease mistrust inside Toshiba, Western Digital has offered to stay out of its consortium at least initially, people briefed on the proposal said, although the details weren't clear.

54,Tue Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'The battle for artificial-intelligence expertise is forcing Apple Inc. to grapple with its famous penchant for secrecy, as tech companies seek to woo talent in a discipline known for its openness. The technology giant this year has been trying to draw attention -- but only so much -- to its efforts to develop artificial intelligence, or AI, a term that generally describes software that enables computers to learn and improve functions on their own. Apple launched a public blog in July to talk about its work, for example, and has allowed its researchers to speak at several conferences on artificial intelligence, including a TED Talk in April by Tom Gruber, co-creator of Apple's Siri voice assistant, that was posted on YouTube last month. Talking up transparency is unusual for a company whose chief executive, Tim Cook, once joked that it is more secretive than the Central Intelligence Agency. The shift is driven by AI's growing importance in areas like self-driving cars and voice assistants such as Siri. Rivals including Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc. have been racing for years to gather talent in the field -- largely by recruiting Ph.D. students and professors from university computer-science programs. Those academics say they want to join companies but still publish regularly, present research and discuss their work. ""We come from a community where we share ideas and get credit for it and a lot of us would be very unhappy to give that up,"" said Noah Goodman, a Stanford University professor of computer science. He works with a research division of Uber Technologies Inc. where he enjoys those perks. Indeed, many big tech companies have embraced academia's relative transparency. They have aggressively recruited top researchers over the years such as Yann LeCun of New York University, who joined Facebook in 2013, and Geoffrey Hinton of the University of Toronto, who joined Alphabet's Google unit in 2013. The companies together also have churned out hundreds of research papers over the past several years. Apple was slow to follow, AI analysts and leading researchers say. And even since its public embrace of greater transparency, it has published a fraction of its competitors' research, and its scientists have avoided speaking about Apple-related research at conferences. To date, the company has published portions of four peer-reviewed research papers on its blog, the Apple Machine Learning Journal. The three posts published this year are attributed to the Siri team and don't name any individual researchers the way academic papers commonly do. At a San Francisco conference in March on using AI in autonomous vehicles, Apple research scientist Charlie Tang gave a presentation on robotics -- but the photo he showed was from Google. He didn't specifically mention any of Apple's work. ""We want to open communication with the [artificial intelligence] community,"" Mr. Tang said in an interview afterward before directing questions about that strategy to Apple executives. Most Apple revenue comes from products like the iPhone or iPad, which are held in strict secrecy before their launch to protect innovations, and ""overcoming that [culture] is difficult,"" said Jack Clark, who heads strategy at OpenAI, a nonprofit, artificial-intelligence research group. He added that Apple's blog was a positive step for the company. An Apple spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Clark's remarks. Though guarded about products, Apple is a longstanding member of industry standards groups like the World Wide Web Consortium and has contributed to open-source projects over the years. Competitive concerns are one reason companies might want to be careful about discussing AI work. But Dr. Goodman of Stanford said companies generally don't need to worry about losing their competitive edge because the algorithms published in papers only work with proprietary data and remain essentially locked. Apple's continued restraint has stoked skepticism about its pledged transparency and doubts about its ability to recruit researchers. Tom Austin, an analyst in AI at research firm Gartner Inc., said Apple would struggle to ""succeed with a strategy that's bottled up."" Apple in October named Carnegie Mellon University professor Ruslan Salakhutdinov as its director of AI research. He joined Carlos Guestrin, a University of Washington professor whose company Apple acquired in August 2016. Dr. Salakhutdinov announced at an artificial-intelligence conference in December that Apple intended to be more open and would start publishing. Cornell University Library published that month Apple's first research paper since Dr. Salakhutidnov's arrival on improving graphic recognition. Microsoft Research, Google and Facebook AI Research each have published more than 100 papers on artificial intelligence topics since January. '"
55,Tue Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'The largest U.S. company by market value lent a helping hand to the stock market last month. Shares of Apple Inc. climbed more than 10% in August, making the tech giant the best performer among the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 30 components. Apple added 104.57 points to the price-weighted blue-chip index. The Dow finished August up just 56.98 points for the month. When tech stocks sold off in June, Apple stumbled and remained in a funk for much of the summer. But on Aug. 1, the company reported strong earnings, which were lifted by iPad and Mac sales. Apple jumped 4.7% the following session, playing a leading role in propelling the Dow past 22000 for the first time. Since then, shares have largely kept climbing. The stock rose in 16 out of the 23 trading days in August, hitting a string of record highs that added nearly $79 billion to its market value, according to The Wall Street Journal's Market Data Group. The tech giant is now valued at nearly $850 billion, by far the most valuable public company in the U.S. Apple has also propped up the market cap-weighted S&P 500, where the stock accounts for more than 4% of the index. The S&P, which was up 0.1% for the month of August, would have been down 0.4% without Apple, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. But the stock is poised to hit a crossroads this month. Apple is expected to roll out three iPhones, including a 10th anniversary edition, on Sept. 12. Hopes are high, a key reason Apple's stock is up more than 40% since the start of this year. That means even a successful rollout may already be built into the share price. Investors may be starting to take note. If Apple gives up August's gains, it could drag on the broader stock market during a historically volatile month. On the first trading session of September, the stock was up a mere 0.03%, underperforming the S&P 500's 0.2% rise. '"
56,Fri Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Top executives at a range of companies, business groups and academic institutions banded together to voice support for an Obama-era program protecting young, illegal immigrants amid concerns that President Donald Trump could end the policy. In an open letter, more than 350 executives and other organization leaders urged Mr. Trump and congressional leaders to preserve Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a five-year-old program that offers a reprieve from deportation to nearly 800,000 people brought to the U.S. as children??known as ""reamers."" ""Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy,"" the letter says. ""They are part of why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage."" The letter was signed by top executives at dozens of tech firms, including Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, as well as the chief executives of General Motors Co. and Starbucks Corp. and leaders of trade groups, nonprofit groups and investors including Warren Buffett. The effort was coordinated by FWD.us, a pro-immigration lobbying group co-founded by Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who also signed the letter. The White House also has faced pressure to end DACA from critics of the program who complain that it wasn't authorized by Congress and is an overreach of executive authority. A group of conservative states have threatened to sue the administration if it doesn't act to end the program by Sept. 5. Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign called the program an ""unconstitutional executive amnesty,"" but softened his stance after he took office. A White House decision on the program could come this week, The Wall Street Journal reported last Friday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a press briefing Thursday that a final decision concerning DACA hasn't been made. Some U.S. business leaders have become more vocal with objections to Trump administration policies in the wake of events including the president's pullout from the Paris Climate Accord and his comments in reaction to violent protests in Charlottesville, Va. Technology CEOs, in particular, have pressed Mr. Trump to support immigration policies that help more foreign workers stay in the country. The leaders of Apple, Alphabet Inc.'s Google, and other tech giants in February filed a joint amicus brief opposing Mr. Trump's travel ban on Muslim-majority nations. Tech executives also voiced objection in June when the administration decided to delay an Obama-era regulation that would have helped more foreign-born entrepreneurs build startups in the U.S. without a traditional visa. Ending the DACA program could lead to the deportation of important members of the future workforce of the U.S., the executives argue in the new letter. In a separate blog post on Thursday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared his concern about the DACA program's potential repeal. An Indian-born immigrant to the U.S., Mr. Nadella credits his success in part to an ""the enlightened immigration policy that allowed me to pursue my dreams."" Mr. Nadella also signed Thursday's letter. Uber, which appointed Iranian-born Dara Khosrowshahi as its new CEO this week, said in a statement that Dreamers deserve to stay in the U.S. ""Their contributions make America more competitive and they deserve the opportunity to work, study, and pursue the American dream,"" an Uber spokesman said.

57,Fri Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Susquehanna International Group expects Apple Inc. in the September quarter to ship five million units of the pricier new iPhone it is expected to unveil on Sept. 12. A Technology article on Sept. 1 incorrectly said the estimate was 25 million. (WSJ September 8, 2017) (END) Apple Inc. on Thursday confirmed plans to hold its annual product-launch event on Sept. 12 at its new headquarters, making it the inaugural public showcase at the $5 billion campus. The announcement, confirming an article in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, formally sets the stage for the unveiling of a new, showcase iPhone loaded with features such as facial-recognition technology and wireless charging. High expectations for that device have helped fuel a surge in Apple's stock price this year, capped by a nearly 10% run in August. Apple said the event will be held at the Steve Jobs Theater in the new headquarters campus, which is still being completed. The 1,000-seat auditorium is located inside a circular, glass-walled structure with a carbon-fiber roof. The company is expected to unveil three iPhones, including the pricier new model to mark the product's 10th anniversary and updates to the two iPhone 7 models that made their debuts last year. Apple is projected to ship 25 million units of the pricier iPhone in the quarter that ends this month, according to Susquehanna International Group, even though sales of the phone aren't expected to start until Sept. 22. Apple also is expected to unveil a new Apple Watch with an LTE cellular chip that can access wireless services such asemails, texts and calls without being tethered to an iPhone. And the company is likely to show off a new version of its streaming-media device compatible with 4K televisions that offer more than eight million pixels a frame -- significantly sharper than traditional high-definition video.

58,Fri Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Amazon.com Inc. is pouring more resources into Alexa to maintain its edge as competition heats up among artificial-intelligence assistants, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Amazon is adding hundreds of engineers to the Alexa program and giving it hiring preference over other divisions, the people said. It has also put Tom Taylor, a veteran Amazon executive known for scaling high-growth operations, in charge of the business, after the former Alexa chief retired. Alexa powers Amazon's Echo speaker device, which was the first of its kind when it was launched nearly three years ago. The Echo has about three-quarters of the U.S. market for smart speakers, with more than 11 million total devices sold through the end of last year, according to analyst estimates. But the people say Amazon executives are eyeing a land rush they have created, with new or planned devices using similar virtual assistants from Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. All four rivals have access to different, deeper pools of data through their huge device businesses, which could be used to quickly train assistants on user behaviors and language. On Wednesday, Amazon said it was teaming up with Microsoft to allow their voice-enabled digital assistants to work together, a move analysts said would help boost Alexa's content. But the two won't be sharing data. Amazon draws its user data primarily from its retail website, which gives it a big advantage when it comes to shopping and other related machine learning, and its Echo devices. Google gathers data from its widely used search engine in addition to its Android operating system for smartphones. It is directing its voice assistant at Amazon's stronghold, e-commerce, with the partnership it announced with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. last week. Users of its Google Express shopping service will be able to order from the retail giant by voice via Google's virtual assistant. Google's virtual assistant, which responds to ""OK, Google,"" now understands questions as well as Alexa, at about 95%, according to Loup Ventures research, which tested 800 questions on both systems. Google previously lagged behind in a February test, understanding about 77% of queries, versus 94% for Alexa. Google answered 65% of the questions correctly, compared with 54% for Alexa, although both improved. ""If I am the person who is in charge of the Echo, I would be concerned about the war chest of data that Google has to make this experience better,"" says Gene Munster, head of research at Loup Ventures. Amazon declined to comment on its Alexa strategy. Amazon already has bolstered its Alexa business, including the launch last year of the $49.99 Dot, a smaller cousin to the $179.99 Echo. That has helped drive adoption of Alexa because the Dot has sold faster than the Echo, according to an internal document viewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the matter. Amazon also integrated Alexa with outside developers and products, adding more than 15,000 skills that allow consumers to ask Alexa to digitally shake a Magic 8-ball or turn on the lights. Alexa has also been added to devices ranging from Ford Motor Co. cars to Sears Holdings Corp.'s Kenmore refrigerators, which Google is also trying to do. Still, Amazon needs Alexa to keep getting smarter. Josh Vickerson picked up a Dot late last year when it was on sale for $35. The 24-year-old originally tried out features like playing Jeopardy and integrating his Fitbit. Now he uses it to play videos, set timers and turn off the lights. ""It's fun to play with when you first get it,"" said Mr. Vickerson, a Rochester, N.Y.-based web developer. But ""there's no enormous value proposition."" He's considering purchasing Apple's new $349 HomePod, which comes out in December, in which Apple's AI assistant, Siri, is expected to be integrated. Amazon has been accelerating the growth of its Alexa staff at a rapid pace for years??long before competitors emerged. The company recognizes when it has to boost growth in certain divisions to grab more share in an emerging market, the people said. It's unclear exactly how large the Alexa unit's staff is now, but LinkedIn shows nearly 3,000 current Amazon employees with Alexa in their description. Amazon's jobs site recently had nearly 1,500 openings mentioning Alexa. The Alexa division now generally wins when competing within Amazon for promising job candidates and other resources??even against Amazon Web Services, the highly profitable cloud services division, according to the people. Overseeing the effort since June is Mr. Taylo'"
59,Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Parents, it's OK??essential, even??to spy on your children's internet use. Children are getting smartphones, tablets and iPods at earlier ages, but that doesn't mean they're laying low in ""niel Tiger's Neighborhood."" Just peek at your child's browsing history; sometimes elementary schoolers google like teenagers. Even if children don't get lost in the internet forest, they can develop bad habits that are hard to spot day-to-day. This is the Big Parental Concern: Are we ruining our children with screens? What's the middle ground between no tech and an internet and app free-for-all? The built-in restrictions on iPhones and Android devices give parents the ability to lock down many functions and set content filters for media and web browsing. Still, they don't tell parents anything. So a whole industry has developed around monitoring devices, both at home and away. These services, which often borrow tools used by businesses for managing company-issued phones, have a lot to offer: GPS tracking, time limits, daily usage reports, bedtime blackouts and content filtering. But add monitoring and you add to the ethical dilemma: Does keeping up with technology mean condemning our children to a parental police state? Before planting any virtual bugs, I sought absolution??or at least permission??from a leading parenting researcher. ""nitoring is critically important for pre-adolescents and adolescents,"" Alan E. Kazdin, professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale University and director of the Yale Parenting Center, told me. ""Risky behavior starts at that time."" With dangers ranging from violent videogames to pornography, you'd be tempted to keep children away from machines entirely, but ""homework is all online, so you can't say no to web browsers,"" he says. The Tools Dr. Kazdin recommends ways to monitor children without feeling like a spy. But first, let's talk about the tools. Over the past year, we've seen an explosion of monitoring services that work anywhere, separating them from the networking products that have powered at-home parental internet controls. The services often use common elements: child-safe browsers, which funnel web traffic through servers to filter any naughty material; virtual private networks, which can filter all of a device's traffic; and mobile device management, which gives control of certain functions to a remote IT manager_x0014_that is, the service. Parents get a web or app dashboard to control the settings. Android phones and tablets take to deep monitoring better than Apple Inc.'s iOS devices, because Alphabet Inc.'s Google allows developers plenty of under-the-hood access, says Josh Gabel, co-founder and product lead for Qustodio LLC ($55 and up a year). For both iOS and Android, Qustodio can provide web browsing filters, internet access time limits, app time limits and location tracking, but only Android devices get call and text monitoring, and a panic button that lets children send location information to trusted contacts. Likewise, Symantec Corp.'s Norton Family service ($50 a year) provides location, web and search supervision to all platforms, and replaces the iPhone's mobile Safari browser with its own child-proofed one. But only on Android can it offer time limits and monitoring of apps, social networks and text messages. If you want this level of access, Android really is the way to go. Google even offers its own free Android parental control system, compatible with certain recent devices. Just note: While Amazon tablets run a version of Android, they aren't typically compatible with these tools. Amazon offers its own limited monitoring tool at parents.amazon.com. Circle Go provides parents with a breakdown of the amount of time children spend on different apps, and lets parents pause internet access, set bedtimes and adjust content filters. Its developers decided to keep Android and iOS features equal, and are rolling out a system for children to earn screen time by ""ompleting chores or hitting fitness goals. Previously only offered as a $5-a-month add-on to Circle Media Inc.'s parental-control networking hardware, Circle Go will be relaunched as a stand-alone service before the end of 2017. The Flaws The closed nature of iOS can cause problems. Norton Family and Qustodio let parents make all of the icons disappear from their children's screens as an ultimate ""shut off"" move. (Turning off the internet alone won't stop children from using many game apps.) But when the apps come back, iOS arranges them in alphabetical order, not as they were. I never wanted to flip that switch, because it would have been cruel after my children arranged their icons so carefully into tidy folders. Mr. Gabel says Qustodio will soon fix this; Symantec says it's looking for potential workarounds. And then there's the matter of the management profile, which gives the service control of the device: The child can find and delete it. If you want to know whether anyone is spying on your own iPhone, go to Settings > General, then look for Device Management. If it's there, tap it to see which profiles are installed. Just note: It's commonly found on company-issued phones, for your mutual protection. When Circle founder Jelani Memory recently remarried, he put his company's Circle Go software on his 14-year-old stepdaughter's phone. ""She took it off in half an hour,"" he says. He argues that while it's always good to be open about monitoring, a child deleting the profile can stoke conversation. ""For us, it's really important that kids don't feel like they're being stuck inside a prison cell,"" Mr. Memory says, ""and that the social contract is enforced not by the app itself but by the parent and child."" But Mr. Gabel at Qustodio says he would prefer Apple allow parents to lock device management and VPN settings as part of the built-in restrictions. Apple declined to comment. Spyware or Safety Net? While no service I looked at offers a perfect solution, they do offer limited free trials or plans. (For Circle Go, wait until the stand-alone service launches.) There are other tools out there that may tackle your specific concerns, so ask friends and family for recommendations, too. Just steer clear of services promising deeper iOS surveillance in exchange for your Apple iCloud login. Aside from the obvious security concern, they might not actually work as advertised. Dr. Kazdin doesn't advocate any particular child-monitoring software, but he encourages keeping tabs on children??openly. That means getting their buy-in. ""ou say, ??Here's the situation: I need to know what you're doing, and you need your freedom. Help me come up with something we agree on,' ""Dr. Kazdin says. It's important to give children a feeling of choice, even if they don't really have one, he adds. But he also warned there may not be an easy solution once bad b'"
60,Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'BEIJING -- Apple Inc. is now allowing Chinese customers to use local mobile-payment system WeChat Pay for purchases in its App Store, underscoring the expanding reach of the service owned by technology firm Tencent Holdings Ltd. Apple's decision to accept payments from the service came despite recent tensions with Tencent, including over the Chinese company's rollout of a system that has been seen as a rival to the App Store. ""We are committed to offering customers across our ecosystem a variety of payment options that are simple and convenient,"" Apple said in a written statement. In the second quarter of this year, Apple's App Store pulled in more revenue in China -- an estimated $2.2 billion -- than in any other market, according to mobile-analytics firm App Annie. Tencent's latest victory comes as it challenges the Alipay mobile-payment system backed by local rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. As WeChat Pay, which controls 40% of the Chinese market, has gained wider acceptance, Alipay's market share has fallen from 80% in 2014 to about 50% currently, according to iResearch Consulting Group. Apple began accepting App Store payments from Alipay in November 2016 and from state-backed network UnionPay two years earlier. WeChat has become an all-purpose smartphone utility in China, with nearly one billion monthly active users who rely on it for mobile payments, social messaging and entertainment, among other functions. Chinese smartphone users spend so much time on WeChat that some analysts say it could hurt sales of Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone expected in September, because consumers here won't see the need to upgrade their handsets as long as they can access the platform. Apple has said it views Tencent, one of the biggest competitors in mobile games, as a partner. On an earnings call with analysts this month, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Tencent is ""one of our biggest and best developers."" However, the decision to accept WeChat Pay comes as Apple struggles to gain traction with its own mobile-payment system, Apple Pay, which made its debut in China in May 2016. The system's footprint in the country's market is negligible, iResearch says. Also, Apple has sparred with Tencent recently over purchases in the App Store. Earlier this year, Apple forced Tencent's WeChat messaging app to disable its ""tip"" function to comply with App Store rules. The function allowed WeChat users to give small amounts of money to authors and other content creators as gratuities via transfers from mobile-wallet accounts. Apple considered these payments to be in-app purchases, of which it takes a 30% cut. This month, a group of 28 Chinese app developers filed a complaint alleging antitrust violations by Apple, including excessive fees for in-app purchases. The State Administration for Industry and Commerce told The Wall Street Journal in mid-August that it was reviewing the complaint. Apple has said ""most submissions in China are reviewed and approved to be on the store within 48 hours, or less."" It also has said its App Store guidelines apply equally to all developers. '"
61,Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., fierce rivals in cloud computing, are collaborating in another emerging field: voice computing. The companies on Wednesday announced plans to allow their voice-enabled digital assistants??Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa??to work together later this year. The agreement provides each assistant with capabilities they lacked, and poses new challenges to Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, which have their own voice-enabled assistants. Amazon customers who use the company's voice-activated Echo speakers will be able to tap into Microsoft's artificial-intelligence capabilities by saying, ""exa, open Cortana."" They can check their Outlook calendar for coming appointments, for example. At the same time, customers using computers running Windows 10 will be able to say, ""Hey Cortana, open Alexa,"" to turn on the lights in their homes or add items to shopping lists. By joining with Microsoft, Amazon expands Alexa's reach. Morgan Stanley estimates Amazon has sold more than 11 million Echo devices through last year. Cortana is available on the 500 million computers running Windows 10, though Microsoft said in May Cortana has 141 million monthly users. Both services also run on apps available on the mobile operating systems from Apple and Google. ""This is a great move for Alexa, but also a necessary move,"" said Gene Munster, head of research at venture-capital firm Loup Ventures. Right now, Alexa is lacking in some aspects such as email and calendar options, which it gains through the partnership, he said. One thing the companies won't share is data. An Amazon spokeswoman said the companies will only exchange necessary information to process requests that is consistent with both companies' privacy policies. ""Once you open Cortana, all voice data goes to Microsoft and not Amazon,"" she said. Alexa, which emerged in 2014 when Amazon introduced the Echo, has focused on consumer and home-automation needs. Cortana, which made its debut in 2014, works in personal computers as well as Microsoft's Xbox One game consoles. Cortana's strength is in its integration with Microsoft's productivity software, said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with research firm Moor Insights & Strategy. The digital-assistant market is still emerging, with no clear leader. Apple's Siri is on as many as 1 billion devices, Mr. Moorhead estimates. The company will start selling its HomePod speaker later this year, a device that likely will tie into millions of iPhones' and iPads' calendar and email information. Google Assistant is on about 150 million devices that run the latest versions of its Android operating system, Mr. Moorhead said. The company is racing to catch up to Alexa with Google Home, a voice-activated speaker similar to Amazon's Echo. ""There are going to be multiple successful intelligent agents, each with access to different sets of data and with different specialized skill areas,"" Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement. The tie-up is a signal the companies realize the future of voice assistants may be more about the content rather than how it is delivered, said Ahmed Bouzid, a former member of the Alexa team and founder and CEO of Witlingo, which builds voice products for Alexa, Google and Cortana. ""This development is moving towards that world where it really doesn't matter if you access the content through Google or Alexa or Cortana or Siri or Bixby,"" Mr. Bouzid said. w'"

The 4K format offers more than 8 million pixels per frame -- significantly sharper than traditional high-definition video at the same size. Apple will also reveal updates to its iPhone and Apple Watch, according to people briefed on its plans.

However, it wants to charge $19.99 for those movies -- on par with what it sometimes charges for new HD movies, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. Several Hollywood studios want to charge $5 to $10 more for 4K movies, the people said. Conflicts over pricing between Apple and media companies are nothing new. The technology company typically argues lower prices will help expand a category and generate more long-term revenue, while studios often worry more about preserving profit margins and higher prices for higher quality formats. ""I wouldn't tell Apple how to price their iPads,"" said an executive at one studio in talks with Apple. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Closing deals with studios before Sept. 12 is important to Apple as it tries to reignite interest in the TV product it first launched in 2007. The company has been losing market share lately to streaming-media players from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. and Roku Inc., which already offer devices with 4K capability that cost at least 60% less than the $149 Apple TV. Its market share fell to 15% in the first quarter this year from 19% a year earlier, according to Parks Associates, a market research firm. The Apple TV accounts for a fraction of the company's revenue, but research by Kantar Worldpanel has found that owning additional Apple devices strengthens consumer loyalty to the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of sales. ""Historically, Apple has looked at the levers they can pull to be competitive, and they'll have to have richer 4K content to leapfrog other competitors,"" said Matt Smith, vice president at Brightcove Inc., which provides online video services. The availability of Hollywood films in Ultra HD, another term for 4K, also could rejuvenate the iTunes Store. The company's movie rental-and-sales business has been losing market share to rivals such as Comcast Corp. and Amazon, falling below 35% from about 50% in 2012. Ultra HD movies have been available online for less than two years, and an executive at one studio said pricing is still in the testing phase. An executive at another studio said $19.99, Apple's preferred price point, would likely prove more popular with consumers given the vast amount of content available for $12 or less a month from Netflix Inc., which offers a limited number of Ultra HD movies and television shows. Streaming service Vudu, owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., already offers some digital movies in Ultra HD. ""Baywatch,"" from Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures, and ""King Arthur,"" from Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros., cost $29.99 while Walt Disney Co.'s ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is $24.99. Hollywood's biggest studios, a group that includes Disney, Paramount, Warner, Comcast Corp.'s Universal Pictures, 21st Century Fox Inc.'s Twentieth Century Fox, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., are eager to establish a new category for digital movie sales, particularly as that business's growth has been slowing in recent years.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the 4K format offers 4,000 pixels per frame. (Aug. 29) Apple Inc. is scrambling to strike deals with Hollywood studios to offer ultrahigh-definition films on its new Apple TV, but discussions have been hampered by disagreements over pricing, according to people with knowledge of the talks. The tech giant will unveil the new version of its streaming media device at an event Sept. 12 and tout its compatibility with new 4K televisions, people with knowledge of its plans said. The 4K format offers more than 8 million pixels per frame??significantly sharper than traditional high-definition video at the same size. Apple will also reveal updates to its iPhone and Apple Watch, according to people briefed on its plans. Apple wants to have major Hollywood films available in ultrahigh definition on the new device, expected to go on sale later this year. However, it wants to charge $19.99 for those movies??on par with what it sometimes charges for new HD movies, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. Several Hollywood studios want to charge $5 to $10 more for 4K movies, the people said. Conflicts over pricing between Appl""nd media companies are nothing new. The technology company typically argues lower prices will help expand a category and generate more long-term revenue, while studios often worry more about preserving profit margins and higher prices for higher quality formats. ""I wouldn't tell Apple how to price their iPads,"" said an executive at one studio in talks with Apple. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Closing deals with studios before Sept. 12 is important to Apple as it tries to reignite interest in the TV product it first launched in 2007. The company has been losing market share lately to streaming-media players from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. and Roku Inc., which already offer devices with 4K capability that cost at least 60% less than the $149 Apple TV.

66,Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'The newest smartphones are taking their screens to the edge. Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics seem to be doing the same with prices, in what amounts to a gamble to revive growth. The companies dominate the high end of the market. But that part of the business has gotten saturated, curbing the runaway growth they once enjoyed. Apple and Samsung combined accounted for 36% of smartphones sold globally last year -- down from 49% five years ago, according to IDC. Both companies also saw smartphone revenue decline in their latest fiscal years. They are betting they can revive growth by selling ever more expensive phones. Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Note 8 last week, which includes the same edge-to-edge display design as the smaller Galaxy 8 smartphone that went on sale in April. That sort of design uses curved glass and organic light-emitting diode technology to add display space to the phone without increasing its overall size. It is expensive: Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 will start at around $950 depending on the carrier, which is 8% to 12% higher than the starting price of last year's Galaxy Note 7. Apple is expected to introduce three iPhone models Sept. 12. At least one is believed to feature an edge-to-edge display along with a glass-covered frame. Analysts expect this model to start at $1,000 or more. The current iPhone 7 starts at $649. Price increases seem risky in a slowing market, though Apple may be hoping to repeat some of the success of the iPhone 6, which launched in late 2014. That phone was the company's entry into the larger-screen smartphone segment and it paid off handsomely, boosting both iPhone unit sales and Apple's operating profit by more than 36% for the company's 2015 fiscal year. The iPhone's average selling price rose 11% to $671 for the same period. Apple's stock price, which rose about 30% in the six months prior to the iPhone 6 launch, gained another 30% in the six months that followed. Still, prices approaching $1,000 will be a shock. A Barclays survey earlier this month found that only 18% of iPhone users are willing to pay more than $1,000. Both Apple and Samsung have proven skilled at making eye-catching designs. But the price of those designs seems likely to make their customers' eyes bulge. '"

Chicago Ventures, Greycroft, BoxGroup and IrishAngels also participated. Chicago-based Wise Apple offers six different lunches a week, such as macaroni and cheese and chicken tacos. Four or five out of these six recipes change every week. There are also customized meal options, said Rebecca Sholiton, Wise Apple's chief executive and co-founder. Other venture-backed startups competing in meals for children, such as Kidfresh, offer healthier versions of children's frozen meals.

68,Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Good morning. Some people might have assumed MTV's Video Music Awards were due a ""Red Wedding""-style massacre in the ratings this year, as the show aired at the same time as the season finale of ""Game of Thrones."" Not so??well, among teens, anyway. Variety reports that while overall ratings were down 16% in MTV's 18-34 demographic, this year's awards show outperformed ""oT"" in the teen demographic and saw an increase in its share of younger viewers from last year. And for cord-cutters without a cable login to live-stream the event, MTV shared plenty of clips on social media, monetized by sponsorships from brands including Verizon and Taco Bell. Of course, none of this should take away from the incredible draw of ""GoT,"" which scored 16.5 million viewers, a series record. Better the Devil You Know Hot on the heels of CMO Today's Alexandra Bruell reporting on how ad holding companies are under pressure to streamline their complex structures, Publicis Groupe announced it is teaming up with consulting firm CapGemini for a massive project to update the McDonald's restaurant experience. Alex emails to tell me: ""Over five years, the project is expected to generate around $600 million for CapGemini, and around $150 million for Publicis, according to people familiar with the matter."" We've seen many examples in recent months and years of agencies and consultancies laying claim to each other's turf. But, as this project shows, both types of firms are far from being able to do it all. The two French companies are working together on a project that will require digital marketing functions, such as customer-relationship marketing and in-store and mobile app design, as well as back-end technology implementation of new ordering and payment systems. Alex continues: ""A rumor circulated earlier this year of a Publicis-CapGemini merger. It never materialized, but if all goes well with McDonald's, who knows??"" Don't Bite the Hand That BuzzFeeds For years, BuzzFeed's pitch to advertisers and investors was that its native advertising monetization model was the antidote to traditional banner ads: anti-consumer interruptions that encourage users to click away from the content they want to consume. But native ads, particularly the type BuzzFeed produces??such as its ""ear Kitten"" video series for Friskies or sponsored listicles for brands like Taco Bell??require lots of human support and don't scale as easily as programmatic ads. So, with an IPO in sight, it really was only a matter of time before BuzzFeed turned to display advertising, as Business Insider reports. Now BuzzFeed, ""th the help of Google's DoubleClick Ad Exchange and the Facebook Audience Network, has turned on the fire hose. Not only will programmatic result in an immediate revenue boost in BuzzFeed's established markets, but it also will help the media company rev up the money engines in markets where it hasn't yet established human sales teams. How Do You Like Them Apples? Has your iPhone been playing up lately? Have you been holding out to buy a smartwatch until a tech company can convince you the devices are more than just a notifications jail for your wrist? Well, mark your calendar for Sept. 12, as that's when Apple is set for yet another of its big product announcement events, the Journal's Tripp Mickle and Drew FitzGerald report. As we're all familiar with by now, these events are huge marketing showpieces, where you can expect to see Apple's top execs, a celebrity or two (especially given Apple's recent content push), and maybe even ""one more thing."" Center stage, of course, will be the products. Principally, marketers' eyes should be on a new, larger, pricier showcase iPhone. The device is set to have high-end features such as facial recognition and augmented reality, which could open up new ways for brands to interact with consumers. We're also expecting an announcement about a 4K Apple TV box, although, as the Journal reports, the tech giant is battling with Hollywood studios over the price to charge for ultra-high definition movies. Getting premium content on the box will be key to the launch and the marketing campaigns that will follow. Because You're Amazon, Just the Way You Are Amazon told us last week that it was planning to slash prices at Whole Foods to mark its acquisition of the high-end grocery chain. While I noted then that the move could encourage shoppers to reconsider Whole Foods' ""Whole Paycheck"" reputation, the Journal has more on the strategy behind Amazon's recent moves, which follow its well-traveled ""kill on price to win on loyalty"" playbook. For one, the price cuts signify Amazon's intent to ""apply order"" to Whole Foods' decentralized structure, where prices had varied across the chain's 12 regions. Amazon also will be using Whole Foods to push its own-brand products. On Monday, its Echo speaker device was selling in-store at a huge discount of $99.99. (It usually retails for $179.99.) Shoppers who might never have entered Whole Foods' doors could visit just for the tech bargains, then make some impulse purchases while in-store.

69,Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Fitbit Inc. unveiled its long-awaited smartwatch on Monday, elbowing into a crowded market to restart its growth. Fitbit's smartwatch, called the Ionic, priced at $299.95, will compete with incumbents such as Apple Inc.'s Apple Watch, which starts at $269. And while Fitbit is touting the health and fitness features on its device, building on its expertise in fitness trackers, the Ionic lacks some of the technological capabilities of an expected revamp of Apple Watch. The smartwatch is going to ""be a big part of our growth story,"" said Fitbit Chief Executive James Park. He added that the device's ability to marry medical-grade capabilities with the company's mass-market appeal will help position it as an essential product. The Ionic is scheduled to hit stores in October ahead of the critical holiday season. Its fate is pivotal to Fitbit, which last year suffered a lackluster holiday season, driving it to post its first quarterly loss since going public. Sluggish sales led to layoffs. Analysts say that the watch's success will hinge on whether Fitbit is able to leverage its expertise in health and fitness. Fitbit is ""playing to their wheelhouse,"" said Ramon Llamas, research manager of wearables and mobile phones at International Data Corp., a research firm. Consumers said that health and fitness apps were the most desirable feature in their smartwatches, according to a survey conducted by IDC late last year. But competitors such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. have released watches with a variety of features, and ""not everybody wants or is using those features,"" said Mr. Llamas. '"
70,Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Apple Inc. has scheduled a product-announcement event on Sept. 12, according to people briefed on its plans, reinforcing expectations that the technology giant will release new iPhones and a smartwatch well ahead of the holiday shopping season. The company is expected to unveil three iPhones, according to other people familiar with its plans. Those include a showcase iPhone to mark the product's 10th anniversary that is larger and pricier and features an edge-to-edge display and facial-recognition technology, as well as updates to the two iPhone 7 models that started selling last year. Analysts had widely reported in recent months that production glitches on the newest iPhone could cause it to be delayed. If the event proceeds on Sept. 12, its timing would be roughly consistent with iPhone launches in previous years, reassuring investors and customers that the device is on track. Still, it remains to be seen if production shortfalls like those that constrained supplies of the iPhone 6 will crimp sales of the latest handsets. Apple typically begins selling new iPhones about 10 days after unveiling them. In the past two years it has used San Francisco's Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, but people close to the company say it is aiming to use the 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater on its new headquarters campus. The new headquarters, however, aren't finished, and the construction timetable could affect the timing or location of the event, those people said. Apple declined to comment. It often keeps secret the timing and other information about such events until close to the date. Apple's announcement is scheduled to happen a week after sales start in the U.S. for Samsung Electronics Co.'s Galaxy Note 8. The South Korean company's flagship smartphone features a new dual-lens camera similar to the iPhone 7 and one of the largest smartphone screens on the market. Samsung hopes the device convinces some iPhone owners to switch. Apple has increased production in recent weeks of the new showcase iPhone and is poised to expand manufacturing from one plant in China to others, according to people familiar with the process. The expansion bodes well for the company's efforts to meet sales demand for the device during the holiday shopping season, one of the people said. Consumer demand for a new iPhone appears strong. In a recent survey, 52% of people planning to buy a smartphone in the next 90 days said they would buy an iPhone, the highest level since 2010, according to 451 Research, a market-research firm. Expectations for strong sales of the new iPhones have sent Apple's stock to record levels, increasing its market capitalization by 36% to $825.71 billion since the start of the year. The company said this month that it expects to generate $49 billion to $52 billion in sales during the September-ending quarter, a figure Nomura Instinet analysts say suggests Apple will ship about 50 million iPhones in the quarter, a 10% increase from the same time last year. Other analysts estimate Apple will ship fewer iPhones, even factoring in a September product launch. ""This is a game changer because of the new functionality that will really strengthen ties with consumers,"" said John Koczara, senior portfolio manager at LaFleur & Godfrey, a Grand Rapids, Mich.-based investment firm that counts Apple among its largest holdings. ""Not only domestically will it move the needle, but it will also really take share in China and move the needle once again there."" Apple also is expected to unveil a new Apple Watch with an LTE cellular chip that allows it to pull data directly from wireless services, easing the device's current dependency on the iPhone to transmit emails, texts and calls. The new iPhone is expected to feature facial-recognition technology that allows users to unlock the device, and to have augmented-reality capabilities, according to Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with market-research firm Creative Strategies. She said the facial-recognition feature will make Apple Pay faster, while augmented-reality apps will create opportunities to use the device in new ways such as gaming or decorating a home. ""There's going to be enough in this phone to lay the foundation for the future of computing as Apple thinks about it,"" said Ms. Milanesi, who said previous iPhone updates were more ""iterative."" The iPhone's success will hinge largely on its performance in China, said Katy Huberty, a Morgan Stanley analyst. Apple has been losing market share in China to local, low-price rivals like Huawei Technologies Co. and BBK Electronics Corp. Sales declined 16% in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, in the 12 months through June. Investors hope the new high-end iPhone??the exact name of whic""hasn't been disclosed??reverses those declines because it is expected to look different from previous models. Many Chinese consumers treat their devices as status symbols, analysts say, and haven't upgraded in recent years because the iPhone 7, released last September, looked the same as the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s that preceded it. To boost sales, though, Apple will have to persuade consumers to pay more for the new high-end model, which analysts expect to cost as muc'"
71,Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'For years, tech stocks in Asia have risen and fallen with the release cycles of Apple Inc.'s iPhone as component producers gear up to supply new versions. Now, a new type of product is creating a similar buzz among investors in the region. Smart speakers -- voice-activated, internet-connected devices such as Amazon.com Inc.'s Echo -- have scored with consumers by allowing them to make purchases without picking up a phone thanks to onboard assistants like Amazon's Alexa. Apple, Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Samsung Electronics Co. and several Chinese competitors have followed Amazon into the market in search of the next big trend in consumer electronics. That has added to demand for components like semiconductors, speaker modules and motion sensors coming from Asian suppliers, contributing to a supply crunch and lifting margins for those producers. Smart speakers are just taking off, but will have a ""smartphone moment"" at which point they become ubiquitous, said Oliver Lee, investment director at Old Mutual Global Investors, which manages $37 billion in assets. Sales are growing quickly. Some 10.7 million Amazon customers in the U.S. owned an Echo device at the end of the first quarter, up from three million a year earlier, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners LLC. The Echo was first offered to Amazon Prime customers in the U.S. in 2014. Last year, the U.S. company began selling its speakers in Europe. Market-research firm Gartner estimates spending on smart speakers will total $3.5 billion globally by 2021, compared with $360 million in 2015. ""Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod are going to be much more prevalent in the home over the next three to four years,"" Mr. Lee said. ""We're in the early stage for this rollout, and we don't think it's fully priced into the stocks."" Asian tech companies are racing to grab market share. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has released a digital assistant similar to Amazon's Echo, while Samsung is also developing a voice-activated speaker. Baidu Inc. launched a home-control robot called ""Little Fish"" in April and Alibaba e-commerce rival JD.com Inc. sells a smart speaker in the Chinese market called Dingdong. The sudden popularity of these devices has been a boon to component suppliers such as Taiwan's WIN Semiconductors Corp., whose share price has almost doubled this year. Investors are piling into the company, which trades at a discount to highflying tech stocks like Amazon. Data from FactSet show $104 million in new investment from fund managers including Fidelity International during the last six months. Old Mutual has snapped up shares in Hong Kong-listed Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd., whose stock has risen 20% this year. Fund managers including AllianceBernstein LP and Guggenheim Investments have increased their holdings in the company by a total of $82 million in the last six months, according to FactSet. Another beneficiary is Primax Electronics Ltd., a maker of speaker modules for Amazon and Google devices whose shares are up 59% this year. Fund managers, including Lazard Asset Management and J.O. Hambro Capital Management, have invested $95 million in Primax shares this year, according to FactSet. The component makers' shares are a comparative bargain. Amazon trades with a multiple of 147 times next year's estimated earnings, Google parent Alphabet at 25 times next year's earnings, Alibaba at 31 times and Baidu at 28 times. Meanwhile, WIN Semiconductors trades at a multiple of 18.4, Primax at 12.2 times and Hua Hong at 9.8. Still, smart speakers are in their infancy. In contrast, the smartphone industry is expected to generate spending of $400 billion this year, a decade after Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone. In the first quarter, Samsung shipped 79 million smartphones while Apple sold 52 million iPhones, according to Gartner. But the technology powering the voice-commanded assistants like Alexa represents a rich opportunity for investors. Demand for smart speakers is expected to help spur what Nomura describes as an ""unprecedented super cycle"" for semiconductors, in particular dynamic random access memory, known as DRAM. The chips are used for servers powering cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which underpins speech-recognition software. Stocks expected to benefit from the added demand include Samsung Electronics -- which Nomura expects will surpass Intel as the biggest semiconductor company -- and South Korean rival SK Hynix Inc., shares of which have more than doubled in value during the past year. Fund managers say the rally has further to go. Hardware makers in South Korea and Taiwan that sell components for these products are in a strong position to generate higher margins for the foreseeable future, said Arthur Kwong, head of Asia Pacific equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, which manages 580 billion. ""There's quite a high barrier to entry,"" Mr. Kwong said. ""A lot of Chinese companies are trying to move into this space, and it'll take a long time for them to develop the required technology.""

72,Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'DES MOINES, Iowa??Iowa approved a deal Thursday to give Apple Inc. $208 million in state and local tax breaks to build two data-storage centers near Des Moines and to create at least 50 jobs. Apple is the latest tech company to plant roots in Iowa. Google, Facebook and Microsoft have already built billion-dollar data centers in Iowa. Like Apple, they were drawn to the state by its generous tax breaks, wind-generated electricity and relative security from natural disasters that could disrupt service. In addition to the promised jobs, Apple agreed to buy 2,000 acres of land for the $1.4 billion project, enough to allow for future development, said Debi Durham, the state's economic development director. At an event with Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds outside the Capitol building, Apple CEO Tim Cook credited Iowa's ""orld-class power grid"" and what he called the state's culture of developing computer programmers who have created applications ranging from education to entertainment. ""At Apple we admire what you guys have accomplished and we want to be a part of it,"" Mr. Cook told cheering supporters. Neither he nor the governor took questions at the event. Mr. Cook promised to invest $100 million to a newly created public improvement fund to be used for community development, including the revitalization of streets, libraries and parks. The deal approved by the Iowa Economic Development Authority includes a refund of $19.6 million in state sale taxes for Apple and a $188 million break on property taxes from Waukee, a suburb bordering Des Moines. Critics questioned the wisdom and fairness of giving such tax breaks to one of the world's richest companies. ""It's a net fiscal loss that it's a straightforward giveaway in the economy to a company that's extraordinarily wealthy, and it makes no sense from an economist's point of view. It only makes sense from a politician's point of view,"" said David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University and critic of such large economic development project tax breaks. Ms. Reynolds, speaking briefly to reporters after the announcement, defended the use of tax credits at a time when the state budget shortfall that may require a special legislative session to address, saying the $19.6 million is a minimal investment for the return Iowa would get.

73,Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Samsung's new Galaxy Note 8 is a Grande-size smartphone with Venti expectations. It succeeds the Note 7, which was perhaps the most talked-about phone of 2017 . . . for all the wrong reasons. And when the Note 8 arrives in stores Sept. 15, it will go head-to-head against Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone in what's expected to be the largest-ever season for phone upgrades. So what is Samsung's strategy for breaking Apple's spell while also making us forget about battery fires? Rather than surprise, the Note 8 mostly just supersizes the things that worked well in this spring's Galaxy S8. Its screen measures 6.3 inches. The Note 8's standout new feature, a dual-lens camera, will make other Samsung owners jealous, but it only just catches up to Apple. When I had the chance to try the Note 8 briefly, ahead of its debut, it was clear this is the phone to beat for anyone looking to max out on screen. In a form that is slightly thinner and taller than the iPhone 7 Plus, the Note 8 packs about 20% more screen. Like the S8, the Note 8 squeezes in more usable screen by slimming the phone's forehead and chin, elongating the display. And its ""infinity"" screen stays trim on the sides by curving down. That curve has a sharper angle than past Samsung phones, which makes the Note 8 slightly easier to hold. Side by side, the Note 8 screen looks like a modest boost from the S8+ model, with a 6.2-inch screen, that Samsung introduced in the spring. But it will feel like an Olympic-size swimming pool for anyone still using the two-year-old Note 5 or any iPhone. Unfortunately, Samsung still doesn't know where to put the fingerprint reader. The Note 8, like the S8, moves it to the back of the phone, awkwardly up near the camera. I'm still waiting for a phone maker to return the reader to the front where it belongs, maybe right in the screen itself. In the don't-break-what-isn't-broken department, the Note 8's S Pen stylus for drawing and taking notes hasn't changed much. One new trick: Like a magic wand, it can now translate complete sentences, rather than just words. The Note 8's software has Samsung's not-always-beloved version of Android, which isn't much changed. They've added the marginally useful ability to pair apps together into a single launch icon. This will let you load duos you frequently use together, say, YouTube and email or navigation and music. To work, the apps themselves must be multiwindow compatible. The phone also has a dedicated button for Bixby, Samsung's newborn voice assistant. Bixby not only answers questions but also operates the entire phone (or at least aspires to). Now let's talk about that hopefully nonexploding Note 8 battery. It's a tiny bit smaller this year, possibly helping it avoid some of the problems that caused fires in last year's model. Independent testing firm UL is publicly vouching for the Note 8 battery, a significant improvement over the just-trust-us approach Samsung took with battery safety in the S8. The Note 8's dual 12-megapixel camera is the feature most likely to make other Samsung owners jealous. Just as on the iPhone 7 Plus, one lens is for wide angle and the other for 2X zoom. Samsung added optical image stabilization to both its lenses, which it says will produce clearer shots. The iPhone 7 Plus has stabilization only on the default wide-angle lens. Like the iPhone, the Note 8 can use depth information from the two lenses to take portraits with only the subject in focus. The Note lets you manually adjust how much background blur to apply -- a feature I've felt was lacking on the iPhone's Portrait Mode. (On the Note 8, you can even adjust it after you take the picture. The Note 8, available in presales on Aug. 24, is too big for my taste. I think the Samsung Galaxy S8 offers just the right amount of screen, 5.8 inches, in a slender package. But by offering a supersize line, Samsung retains loyal customers who want choice. And the Note 8 maintains Samsung's lead on phone design. The new norm for a premium phone in 2017 is a dual-lens camera and a reduced-bezel shape with a huge screen. But there is still room for Apple to impress this fall by fixing the fingerprint reader, addressing battery life -- and perhaps identifying something we didn't even know we wanted. '"
74,Tue Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Well-known investors from Tim Draper to the Winklevoss brothers have been happy to lend their names and public support to cryptocurrency projects that they back. Their endorsements, in turn, have precipitated large follow-on demand from the crowd of investors who wanted to jump on the same bandwagon. Soon after Tim Draper, for example, signaled in the press that he will invest in its initial coin offering, a project called Tezos conducted a public sale of its tokens that drew more than $200 million. Filecoin Network, meanwhile first raised $52 million from hand-picked close advisers, followed by another $200 million from all accredited investors interested. Big-name investors lend a dose of credibility and also help these projects with business development and other support, and there's nothing wrong with that. They also get a significant discount on the public sale. Some say it would only be fair to have the investors announce when they sell out of their positions. Otherwise, the crowd may be following ghosts into tokens. ""The problem is that you've got venture-capital firms backing these projects, signalling that they are committed for the long term...but then they have the opportunity to turn around and sell much more rapidly. It's not a great dynamic,"" said Ryan Selkis, who used to run investments at Digital Currency Group and was most recently at the helm of media and conference company CoinDesk. ""It would be good for investors to make some voluntary disclosures if you've got others investing because of the top-tier names,"" he added. Mr. Draper disagrees. ""People are buying coins the way they buy euros or pesos, not investing as they do in Apple Computer or Starbucks,"" Mr. Draper wrote in an email. ""The hope is that the coin will spread, maybe so it increases in value and maybe so that people get to see a societal change. Some promotion from a prominent person, investor or otherwise can help give it a boost, but long term, it either catches on or it doesn't."" Significant investors in public companies, of course, are required to file disclosures about insider trading. It is possible that some of the existing digital tokens could be considered securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission, an attorney said. If they had been sold to the public, then they could be considered public securities and disclosure rules would apply. But Mr. Draper hopes that doesn't happen. ""Our system for taking companies public is hurting companies and making them less competitive...I would not like to see this exciting new platform follow Sarbanes Oxley, tearing down American competitiveness.""

75,Tue Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'One of the world's largest music companies agreed to license its songs to a startup that aims to help musicians and record labels make money when their material is used in DJ mixes and mashups played online. Sony Music Entertainment is the first major music company to reach a deal with New York-based Dubset Media Inc., which has so far partnered with about 35,000 smaller labels and music publishers. Dubset's technology determines how much of a given song is used in a mix created by a DJ and calculates royalties owed to various rights holders. Dubset executives described the remix market as a massive untapped revenue source for the music industry. The company reached agreements last year to add its remixes to the libraries of Spotify AB and Apple Inc.'s Apple Music. Andre Stapleton, a business-development executive at Sony Corp.'s recorded-music unit, said the Dubset deal ""not only protects our artists, but also provides us with the tools to harness new revenues for them, while amplifying the popularity of the original master recordings at the same time."" Dubset chief executive Stephen White said the average DJ mix is 64 minutes long and contains 22 songs, with interests held by more than 100 different rights holders. In a statement, Dubset said DJ-created remixes, like original music, must be independently registered, tagged and cleared before becoming available on any subscription music streaming service. The company said its technology identifies recordings sampled within DJ sets, determines the label and publishing rights holders and clears the DJ sets across all rights holders in a matter of minutes. ""This brings huge value to artists who historically have not had the ability to monetize their content used in DJ mixes and [it is] also recognition of what amazing musicians DJs are,"" Mr. White said. Having Sony sign on is ""a huge validation of what we're doing,"" he said. It has been a long time coming, too. Mr. White said getting labels, artists and publishers on board and setting license agreements has been difficult. ""The cross-clearance network we've had to build requires us to have large number of labels on board,"" he said. ""It has been a heavy technology build."" '"
76,Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'It was a memorable moment in Pixar's 2004 classic ""The Incredibles,"" one that seemed wildly futuristic at the time: Mr. Incredible picks up a wafer-thin tablet computer, and it scans his face to verify his identity before divulging his secret mission. Thirteen years later, many slim phones and tablets unlock with the press of a thumb??and just this sort of mobile facial scanning is on the way. Forget fiddling with passwords or even fingerprints; forget multiple layers of sign-in; forget credit cards and, eventually, even physical keys to our homes and cars. A handful of laptops and mobile devices can now read facial features, and the technique is about to get a boost from specialized hardware small enough to fit into our phones. Using our faces to unlock things could soon become routine, rather than the purview of spies and superheroes. Qualcomm Inc., an industry leader in mobile device chips, recently introduced its Spectra imaging system, which can extract depth information from objects including faces. The company plans to include the technology in a forthcoming generation of its flagship Snapdragon mobile processors. Meanwhile, when firmware for Apple Inc.'s forthcoming HomePod speaker leaked online, developers spotted clues suggesting that an upcoming iPhone might have similar depth perception and faci"" recognition. This technology is different from, but related to, the facial recognition increasingly built into security cameras around the world, which cross-references pictures of your face against databases of millions. That tech is growing in capability and in use??especially in China, where its applications range from surveillance to payments. Fortunately, your phone's camera has a few advantages over surveillance equipment. It doesn't need to spot you in a crowd. It just needs to distinguish one face??yours??and it can do that very well, since you're not some shadowy figure captured in bad light. From a foot or two away, your phone can quickly capture a detailed image. There's another advantage. Depth-sensing technology, generally called ""uctured light,"" sprays thousands of tiny infrared dots across a person's face or any other target. By reading distortions in this field of dots, the camera gathers superaccurate depth information. Since the phone's camera can see infrared but humans can't, such a system could allow the phone to unlock in complete darkness. While Apple hasn't announced any use of this technology??let alone confirmed whether it will exist inside the widely expected 10th-anniversary iPhone??the company is no stranger to infrared depth-mapping and facial recognition. It has previously""en granted patents describing nearly identical processes. Apple declined to comment on any technology it might be working on. If this technology sounds familiar, it's a sort of shrunken-down version of the Xbox 360's Kinect motion sensor. Perhaps not coincidentally, Apple acquired an early Kinect developer, the Israeli startup PrimeSense, in 2013. Meanwhile, Qualcomm says it plans to make its Spectra processor available for future Android phones. Previous Samsung image processors that did face recognition could be fooled by holding up a photo of someone's face to a phone's camera. Qualcomm insists that depth perception gives the added bonus of ""live-ness detection."" As a result, a 3-D printed mask wouldn't be able to fool the system, though the company admits identical twins might. Teaching our phones what our faces look like will be just like teaching them our fingerprints, says Sy Choudhury, a senior director at Qualcomm responsible for security and machine-intelligence products. An image of your face is captured, relevant features are extracted and the phone stores them for comparison with your face when you unlock the phone. As with fingerprint recognition, the facial images are securely stored only on the device itself, not in the cloud. History??from Apple's battles with domestic law enforcement over unlocking iPhones to Amazon's insistence that the Alexa doesn't upload anything until it hears its wake word??suggests companies will use this privacy as a selling point. Already, laptops use Microsoft's Windows Hello face recognition for easier unlocking; some devices are equipped with Intel's RealSense 3-D depth camera, which preceded Qualcomm's Spectra. As technology like this gets into the mobile supply chain, it eventually trickles d"" to less-expensive, lower-end devices along with dedicated, highly efficient chipsets, says Joey Pritikin, founder and co-chief executive of biometrics company Tascent. Facial recognition is likely one day to appear in camera-enabled smart doorbells and locks, as well as in smart speakers like Amazon's camera-equipped Echo Show, where personalization would be a benefit: If it knew it was you, it might offer the latest ""Game of Thrones"" episode; if, instead, it spotted your child, there's ""Sesame Street."" Qualcomm already has customers in its Spectra pipeline working on nonphone products, including internet-connected cameras, says Mr. Choudhury. Like all new technologies, facial recognition is likely to come with trade-offs. In many contexts, a fingerprint scan ma'"
77,Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'SEOUL -- For Samsung Electronics Co ., the launch this week of a new smartphone and a court ruling for its detained de facto leader may offer closure and clarity for a company rocked by two scandals over the past year. Samsung will unveil the Galaxy Note 8 on Wednesday in New York, releasing what it hopes will be a bounceback version of a flagship device that the South Korean firm had to recall last year. Then, on Friday, a South Korean court will rule on bribery allegations against Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong, who has stood trial since April. The pair of crises, nonetheless, hasn't hurt Samsung 's bottom line: It posted a record second-quarter net profit last month of 11.05 trillion won ($9.9 billion) to outearn Apple Inc . for the first time in recent years. Fueled by rapid growth in internet-connected devices, Samsung 's semiconductor unit has become the world's largest chip maker by revenue, grabbing a top spot that Intel Corp . had held for nearly a quarter-century. The fate of Mr. Lee -- a verdict will determine whether he can return to work -- carries huge significance for the Samsung empire, which, like other South Korean conglomerates, looks to the controlling family to sign off on major strategic decisions. A prolonged absence by Mr. Lee, the Harvard-educated grandson of Samsung 's founder, would create a leadership vacuum atop the conglomerate that spans smartphones, theme parks and biopharmaceuticals. A Samsung spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Lee, 49 years old, has been in jail since February in connection with five charges centering on alleged bribes linked to South Korea's former president Park Geun-hye. Prosecutors say Mr. Lee sought greater control over Samsung , including pursuing government backing for a merger of two Samsung affiliates that would have given him that power. The prosecutors' case stems from $37 million Samsung agreed to pay to entities linked to a close friend of Ms. Park. Mr. Lee has denied all charges against him. Prosecutors have recommended a 12-year sentence for Mr. Lee, the Samsung Electronics vice chairman who has effectively led the conglomerate after his father became incapacitated due to a heart attack in 2014. Earlier this month, a key lieutenant testified Mr. Lee wasn't involved in the payments' decision making. Still, experts said it would be difficult for Mr. Lee not to shoulder responsibility for them. If convicted, Mr. Lee is likely to face at least a five-year sentence, according to legal experts. Under South Korean law, any sentence longer than three years cannot be suspended. The ruling can be appealed, ultimately to the Supreme Court. Mr. Lee's trial will set a new milestone for how the country's business entities interact with the government, said Park Ju-gun, head of CEO Score, a corporate analysis firm. It also will confirm the current administration's stance on questionable succession practices among conglomerate family owners amid public anger over the historically close ties between government officials and top corporate executives. Samsung , the world's largest smartphone maker, saw its brand get bruised after last year's Galaxy Note 7 debacle, a recall that cost it more than $6.5 billion and led to a widespread ban on the devices being carried onto aircraft due to fears it was a fire safety hazard. The Galaxy Note 8 offers Samsung its final chance to impress consumers ahead of the release of Apple's 10-year anniversary iPhone later this year. The Galaxy S8, Samsung 's other flagship device that hit shelves in April, had 19.2 million shipments in the second quarter, outperforming its predecessor, the Galaxy S7, by 28% versus the same period a year earlier, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics. ""The S8 was the world's best-selling Android smartphone in the first half of 2017,"" said Neil Mawston, Strategy Analytics executive director. ""The Note 8 is going to be like an S8 on steroids, accompanied by heavy marketing spend and deep retail distribution."" '"
78,Fri Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook joined the chorus of high-profile business leaders who have felt compelled to share their views on Donald Trump's response to Saturday's white-supremacist protests amid widespread unease on the part of their employees, customers and others. Mr. Cook called the events in Charlottesville, Va., ""repulsive"" in an email to employees, saying he disagrees ""with the president and others"" who see a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis on one side and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights on the other. ""Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans,"" Mr. Cook wrote in the email late Wednesday, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. He said he felt compelled to speak out on the events, which he found personally troubling, in part because he heard from many people at Apple ""who are saddened, outraged or confused."" ""What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country,"" he wrote. ""We must not witness or permit such hate and bigotry in our country, and we must be unequivocal about it. This is not about the left or the right, conservative or liberal. It is about human decency and morality."" Mr. Cook's memo echoed sentiment expressed in staff memos penned this week by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. CEO Doug McMillon, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. chief James Dimon and Ernst & Young Global Chairman and CEO Mark Weinberger. Mr. McMillon said Mr. Trump had ""missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists."" Aetna Inc. Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said in a memo to his staff that he was ""ashamed of our President's behavior and comments. ??We are not a country of hate, and we are all judged by our own god based on the compassion and humanity we show others."" Beyond the sheer number of prominent CEOs taking such public action, the memos are noteworthy because they don't address administrative policy positions that affect day-to-day business, but rather rebuke the president on his leadership approach on a broad social and moral issue. The executives' overarching message was that they couldn't remain silent as the president appeared to equate white supremacists and Nazis with counterprotesters standing against racism. William W. George, a Harvard Business School professor and former chief executive of device-maker Medtronic PLC, said that while corporate leaders have in the past criticized policy decisions by previous administrations, such direct opposition to a president is unusual. ""I've never seen this before,"" Mr. George said. CEOs he had spoken to said they ""didn't want to embarrass the president, but they felt they needed to stand up and be counted in the absence of moral clarity from the White House."" Not all CEOs who weighed in on the past week's controversy directly criticized Mr. Trump. International Business Machines Corp. chief Ginni Rometty, for example, didn't mention the president directly in her memo criticizing the actions in Charlottesville and calling for unity, which she sent staff after the dissolution of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, on which she sat. The CEOs' criticism of the president marked a departure from some of the optimism many expressed at the outset of the Trump administration that the new president would be a business-friendly leader who would revise the tax code and reduce regulation. Much of that goodwill had eroded even before this week, thanks to policies that many executives and employees opposed. Tech executives and workers, many of whom were born abroad, were especially angered by Mr. Trump's initial immigration order that banned entry to the U.S. of nationals from seven majority-Muslim nations. Mr. Cook sent memos to employees about the immigration ban and about Mr. Trump's June withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, but those emails focused on the company's support of immigration and the belief that climate change is real. They stopped short of directly criticizing the president as Mr. Cook did in his email this week. Mr. Cook's latest memo also said Apple will contribute $1 million each to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League. The company also plans to match employee contributions 2-for-1 to those organizations and other human-rights groups through next month, and to enable iTunes customers to join in contributing to the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""These have been dark days, but I remain as optimistic as ever that the future is bright,"" Mr. Cook said. '"

80,Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple Inc. has set a budget of roughly $1 billion to procure and produce original content over the next year, according to people familiar with the matter -- a sign of how serious the maker of iPhones is about making a splash in Hollywood. Combined with the company's marketing clout and global reach, the step immediately makes Apple a considerable competitor in a crowded market, where both new and traditional media players are vying for original shows. Apple's budget is about half of what Time Warner Inc.'s HBO spent on content last year, and on par with estimates of what Amazon.com Inc. spent in 2013, one year after it announced its move into original programming. Apple could acquire and produce as many as 10 television shows, according to the people familiar with the plan, helping fulfill Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue's vision of offering high-quality video, similar to shows such as HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" on its streaming-music service or possibly a new, video-focused service. Apple declined to comment. The budget will be in the hands of Hollywood veterans Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, poached in June from Sony Corp. to oversee content acquisition and video strategy. They exited their Sony contracts a month early and began work this month from Apple's Los Angeles offices, where they are taking over programming responsibilities from the Apple Music team, according to the people familiar with the matter. Apple's existing video business -- movie and TV-show rental via iTunes -- has been challenged by the rise of Netflix and other video-subscription services that charge a monthly fee. Last year, iTunes generated an estimated $4.1 billion in revenue, but its share of the movie rental-and-sales market has dropped below 35% from about 50% in 2012. Apple hopes original video bolsters the appeal of movie rentals and other offerings on iTunes -- a critical contributor to its $24.35 billion in annual services revenue. Apple aims to double the business, which also includes App Store sales, Apple Pay and Apple Music, to about $50 billion by 2020. It won't be easy to catch up with Amazon and Netflix Inc., which have considerable head starts and far bigger programming budgets. And Apple has to avoid jeopardizing its 15% cut of subscription revenues its app stores take in for services like Netflix and HBO Go. Hollywood has become a battleground as consumers increasingly sever cable subscriptions and transition to streaming services like Netflix or Hulu. The disruption has fueled competition between tech and traditional media companies eager to sell subscriptions or generate ad revenue with new entertainment programming. It has also fueled a major increase in scripted programming, which rose to more than 500 shows during the recently ended 2016-2017 season, nearly double the 2011 total. In addition to Amazon and Apple, Facebook Inc. has begun acquiring original programming, like a reality show on NBA player Lonzo Ball's family; Alphabet Inc.'s Google has announced a $35-a-month streaming TV service. Netflix has aimed to outflank tech rivals by recruiting star TV producers like Shonda Rhimes, who developed ABC hits like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Scandal."" Meanwhile, Walt Disney Co. announced this month it will pull its movies from Netflix and launch its own streaming service. David Hill, former senior executive at 21st Century Fox Inc., said Apple's recent entertainment hires give it a chance to catch up with established players like Netflix and Amazon. But the flood of new scripted shows is making it increasingly hard to attract viewers, he said. ""There's just not enough time"" to watch, Mr. Hill said. Programming costs can range from more than $2 million an episode for a comedy to more than $5 million for a drama. One episode of some high-end shows such as ""Game of Thrones"" can cost more than $10 million to produce. When Netflix released its back-to-back successes ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange Is the New Black,"" its annual budget for original and acquired programming was about $2 billion. This year it is expected to spend more than $6 billion. To gain relevance, Apple needs at least one hit, the people familiar with the plan said. Its initial video efforts via Apple Music -- ""Planet of the Apps"" in June, and ""Carpool Karaoke"" out last week -- were criticized by reviewers. But with $215.64 billion in revenue last fiscal year and more than $261 billion in cash on its balance sheet, Apple could quickly ramp up spending. Messrs. Van Amburg and Erlicht have begun meeting with Hollywood agents about shows Apple could acquire, the people familiar said. They hired Matt Cherniss, former president of WGN America, to oversee development. The types of shows Mr. Cherniss made at WGN America have bolstered Hollywood's expectations that Apple wants high-quality scripted programming -- in contrast with Facebook, whose initial programming includes shows about cheese from Business Insider and dog DNA testing from Mashable.

81,Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'A couple of years ago, news that Apple planned to spend $1 billion to produce original content would have sent a tremor through shares of Netflix and media companies. On Wednesday, those stocks barely budged. Apple wants to produce original content to air on its music-streaming service or on a new video-focused service, and it is budgeting $1 billion to do it, The Wall Street Journal reported. This isn't the first time the tech giant has signaled an interest in joining the crowded field of original content producers. This time, however, the market is smart enough to know that spending a lot of money doesn't guarantee success in original programming, particularly because the competition is already spending a lot more. Among Big Tech, Netflix is expected to spend well over $6 billion on content this year, while Amazon is likely to spend more than $4 billion. Meanwhile, Facebook and YouTube are also producing original content. Then there are the traditional media companies, for whom content creation is the primary business and which have deep relationships with Hollywood talent. Media companies already complain that Netflix is driving up the cost of content with its big spending ways. To get the best shows, Apple will have to spend even more, reducing the value of content ownership. And even if Apple can produce shows that people want to watch, the flood of high-quality original content already hitting the market means stiff competition for consumers' time and attention. '"

That money is what Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. terms as ""traffic acquisition costs"" paid in exchange for Apple making Google's search engine the default on its mobile internet browser. For Apple, this money equates to a very-high-margin revenue stream for its services business, which is on track to generate about $29 billion in revenue this year, up 19% from last year, according to Wall Street's current consensus.

83,Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'For a company that first made a name for itself in maps, Garmin should get more credit for seizing a solid niche in the turbulent world of smartwatches. That was no simple feat. Putting navigation devices into cars was a highly profitable market until smartphones came up to the task. Meanwhile, wearable technology isn't an easy market to crack. Fitbit has long led the fitness band market with a wide range of devices across several price points, while Apple Inc. has quickly taken over the burgeoning smartwatch market. Apple accounted for about 51% of smartwatches sold globally in the first half of this year, according to Counterpoint Research. Garmin accounted for only about 3%, but it has been making the most of that niche. Garmin has been able to apply its GPS expertise to produce devices popular with athletic customers willing to pay extra to keep closer tabs on their activities. Garmin's Fenix smartwatch in particular has proven to be a hit. Sales in Garmin's Outdoor segment, which includes the Fenix, surged 35% in the first half of this year compared with a year earlier. That effectively doubled the company's market share, per Counterpoint's reckoning. Operating margins in Garmin's outdoor segment also reached their highest in nearly three years in the second quarter. It is worth noting that Garmin accomplished this against a refreshed version of the Apple Watch that launched last fall. That should earn Garmin an extra look from investors. Garmin's share price has risen by half the Nasdaq Composite's gain this year. At 18 times forward earnings, Garmin currently features a 17% discount to the Nasdaq compared with an average 7% discount over the last five years. The company has had to manage steady declines in its legacy auto navigation business. Some of the stock's recent weakness stems from a slowdown in the fitness band market. Revenue in Garmin's fitness category rose barely 1% year over year in the second quarter. Category leader Fitbit, however, saw revenue plunge 40% in the same period. Garmin's aviation and marine businesses also are growing and keep the company from becoming too reliant on wearables. Aviation in particular has a lot of potential, given new standards for air-traffic control that will require private planes to be outfitted with new transponder equipment of the type that Garmin sells. The smartwatch contest is heating up too. Fitbit is expected to launch a new device later this year, while Apple is widely rumored to be working on a version of its smartwatch that can connect directly to cellular services. Garmin hinted in its last earnings call that it has its own new products on the way. Those should be worth a look, as the company's smartwatch efforts to date have managed to tick all the right boxes. '"

86,Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'SHANGHAI -- In his 2005 book ""One Billion Customers,"" a how-to guide for navigating the China market, James McGregor offered this advice: ""Never 'tremble and obey' if doing so will damage or destroy your business in China."" Tell that to today's American CEOs. When authorities ordered Apple Inc. to pull unauthorized apps that help internet users get around censorship controls, it agreed. Chief Executive Tim Cook defended the move by saying the company was merely following Chinese law. His compliance, though, illustrates a challenge that the Trump administration faces as it builds a case against unfair Chinese trading practices. Washington has a CEO problem. U.S. corporate chiefs are focused on preserving their short-term profits in China by trying to stay on the right side of a hard-line -- and increasingly antiforeign -- regulatory regime. If, as expected, the White House goes after China's rampant intellectual property abuses, the companies will be torn. Just about everybody in the U.S. capital is complaining about how China forces foreign companies to give up technology in return for market access. Everybody, that is, except the immediate targets of the state-directed heist -- the companies themselves. CEOs of U.S. high-tech companies have been notably silent, even though their operations are highly vulnerable: China makes no secret of wanting their technology so it can replace them on its way to building itself into a manufacturing superpower. Yet, not only do they refrain from criticism, some actively cooperate. U.S. tech giants have invested billions of dollars in tie-ups with state entities at the forefront of projects like ""Made in China 2025"" aimed at gaining Chinese dominance in emerging industries from driverless cars to robotics. Why the passivity? China now owns the world's fastest-growing consumer markets by far, and U.S. CEOs believe they must be there come what may. They expect retaliation for complaining. But there is also a psychology at work that reflects the new dynamics of power in the global economy. A China making rapid technological strides is feeling supremely confident, and this is reflected in its attitudes toward international investors. In any U.S.-China trade conflict, U.S. CEOs will be caught in a tough bind between two arch-nationalists -- President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. ""Actually, you can say that Xi Jinping is more important than Trump to many U.S. CEOs,"" says Mr. McGregor, the book author who is also chairman for greater China of business consulting firm APCO. Previously he worked as The Wall Street Journal's bureau chief in Beijing, and later ran Dow Jones's business operations in China. There is virtually no recent precedent for U.S. corporate resistance in China. Those who point to Google as a brave exemplar -- it exited the country in 2010 rather than censor its searches -- miss quite a bit of nuance. Google pulled its search engine only after Chinese hackers broke into its systems in search of source code. In other words, it fled an existential threat as much as an ethical dilemma. Now Google and its parent company, Alphabet, want back in. If Google gets its wish -- or Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg makes the entry he so clearly craves -- it will be on Chinese censorship terms more onerous than ever. As Lu Wei, the former head of the Cyberspace Administration of China, once put it: ""I have a choice about who comes to be a guest at my home."" And for how long they can stay: Increasingly, high-tech companies assume that, in the end, all their products are in mortal danger; once they've achieved a certain market share, and Chinese companies are strong enough to compete, the technology is liable to be nationalized, or shoved aside. By this logic, Apple is on a risky trajectory. Local smartphone brands like Vivo and Oppo are closing in. Apple's decision to pull apps that circumvent the Great Firewall drew sharp condemnation from a key group of consumers. In his earnings call last week, Mr. Cook said he hoped for fewer restrictions in China in the future. Apple declined to comment further. But obedience, in this case, has damaged Apple's public image if not its bottom line. And the rewards for compliance are far from certain. '"
87,Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'TOKYO_x0014_Embattled Apple Inc. supplier Japan Display Inc. said it wouldn't rule out a partnership with a Chinese or Taiwanese company to survive_x0014_a departure from its original aim of being Japan's national champion in the display business. Executives at the smartphone-screen maker Wednesday apologized for what they described as poor management and laid out an across-the-board restructuring plan, including the slashing of 3,700 jobs world-wide_x0014_nearly 30% of its total workforce. The company also intends to shut domestic factories and shrink its overseas operations. Japan Display booked a net loss of ?31.5 billion ($286.4 million) for the April-June quarter. The company's struggles are the latest sign of difficulty in Japan's technology industry. Toshiba Corp. is trying to stay afloat after the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Co., left it with an estimated loss of nearly $9 billion. Last year, iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group of Taiwan acquired Sharp Corp. Japan Display was created by the Japanese government in 2012 by combining units of Sony Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp., part of an effort to keep the country's electronics-manufacturing knowledge out of foreign hands. However, Japan Displayhas been hurt by a constant sh""rtage of cash, hampering its ability to spend on next-generation technology to stay competitive. Nobuhiro Higashiiriki, who recently became Japan Display's chief executive, said it would rule no one out as a potential strategic partner, including companies from Taiwan and China, suggesting the government has approved of such a possibility. People familiar with the matter said display makers from China, South Korea and Taiwan have recently visited Japan Display's domestic factories. Still, the extent of outside interest in the company remains uncertain. Visitors from Chinese companies have balked at the terms presented by Japan Display, people directly involved in the discussions said. More than 50% of the company's revenue is derived from the liquid-display panels it supplies to Apple, but analysts have said they expect the iPhone maker to adopt newer organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, displays??which Japan Display doesn't manufa'"

(Aug. 10, 2017). Also, the proposed Foxconn facility in Wisconsin would build liquid-crystal display technology, or LCD, similar to screens used for Apple Inc.'s iPhone. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the facility would build screens used for the iPhone. (Aug. 11, 2017) Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker defended a $3 billion tax-incentive package to lure Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group to the state, amid a growing chorus of concerns about the hefty bill to taxpayers. ""We believe this is transformational,"" Mr. Walker said Wednesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. ""We think in terms of attracting talent across the country and around the world."" In a White House ceremony last month, President Donald Trump announced that Foxconn would be investing $10 billion to build a 20 million-square-foot campus in southeastern Wisconsin that could employ up to 13,000 workers over a period of up to six years. The facility, which would build liquid-crystal display technology, or LCD, similar to screens used for Apple Inc.'s iPhone, would be the first of its kind in North America. The deal, which must be approved by the state legislature, will come at a high cost to taxpayers. The state is offering one of the largest incentive packages to a foreign company, according to tax experts. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., would receive $2.85 billion in state income tax credit over 15 years and up to $150 million in tax exemptions for building materials and supplies used to construct its Wisconsin campus. Foxconn in 2014 explored opening a U.S. display factory, aimed at reducing the costs of shipping large-screen TVs from Asia. That potential $40 million investment in manufacturing and research facilities in Pennsylvania didn't advance because U.S. local governments didn't offer terms that were favorable enough, the Journal previously reported. Mr. Walker said the benefits of the deal went beyond the number of jobs that would be created from the facility itself. Instead, he said, the deal should be viewed as a way to make Wisconsin a hub for technology jobs and venture capital investment. He said as a ""cutting-edge technology"" firm, Foxconn would help the state attract young talent and retain its college graduates. He also thinks its most crucial benefit would be changing the popular image of Wisconsin and the benefits of living there. ""We think that will change people's perceptions, particularly young people,"" he said. On Tuesday, a state fiscal analysis found that taxpayers wouldn't recoup their investment until the 2042-2043 fiscal year. That analysis is leading some members of the state legislature to question the wisdom of the deal. ""Traditionally, these incentive packages, when we look back at them, tend to be expensive, inefficient and have a lot of unintended consequences,"" said State Rep. Gordon Hintz, a Democrat whose district includes Oshkosh. ""We all want to be seen as doing something proactive but there's a large body of public policy research that lets you know you can't buy sustainable economic development."" The state assembly has already begun discussions over the bill and its committee on jobs and the economy plans to vote Monday, said House Speaker Robin Vos. The senate is beginning internal discussions and a joint committee on finance is expected to start discussions in the next two weeks. But Mr. Walker, a Republican, said he is confident the bill will be passed before Labor Day, which falls on Sept. 4. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said in an interview that he expects the bill to pass the Republican-majority state legislature, but didn't confirm that he had enough votes??which could signal that the deal could be in trouble. ""e saying I don't have the votes is different than the votes aren't there,"" he said. ""I don't start counting noses until they go through the process. I'm not going to assume anybody is an aye."" Mr. Fitzgeraldcautioned that the analysis of the benefit to the state is ""very very speculative."" The state says that in addition to the $10 billion direct investment and 13,000 jobs created by the facility, the project will lead to 10,000 construction jobs and 22,000 indirect jobs. But those numbers aren't easy to calculate. ""I think that's part of what we're realizing is that this is going to be very difficult to put a fine point on,"" said Mr. Fitzgerald. ""There's bipartisan concerns over Gov. Walker's $3 billion corporate welfare package,"" said Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling. ""The best day that this deal had was the day it was unveiled and every day afterwards have been a constant line of questions."" Tax incentives are a way to lure companies to invest in states, and often lead to fierce competition among them. The total annual cost of tax incentives reached $45 billion by 2015, according to Timothy Bartik, an economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich. Boeing Inc. received a historic $8.7 billion tax incentive package from Washington state. Nevada granted California-based Tesla Inc. $1.3 billion in incentives to build a battery plant outside Sparks, Nev. Such deals are often considered transformational to a state's economy and thus viewed as justifying the cost to taxpayers. ""The ability to win a mega project is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,"" said Kate Crowley, a consultant with the Chicago-based firm Baker Tilly Virchow Krause LLP. But Mr. Bartik, and others, question whether the Foxconn deal would truly be transformational. The state's fiscal analysis doesn't account for the increased cost to taxpayers from an influx of migration to the state. Mr. Bartik and others have also raised questions about commuters from Illinois whose income taxes are paid back to their home state through a reciprocity agreement with Wisconsin. Gov. Walker says he isn't worried about that possibility. He thinks once people in Illinois realize how great Wisconsin is, they will move across the border. ""When they look at the stability in Wisconsin, housing stock, all the other things that have been positive, they're gonna want to live in Wisconsin,"" he said. o'"
89,Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'An order from Apple is a blessing for electronic component makers. But that can turn into a curse when the supplier doesn't keep innovating -- as Japan Display has shown. The Japanese display maker, which supplies screens to iPhones, said Wednesday it would cut 30% of its jobs and restructure its businesses after reporting its fifth quarterly loss in the past six quarters. Its main business of making liquid-crystal displays for smartphones has been hammered by cheap Chinese rivals. But more importantly, the company faces an existential threat as Apple, which contributes to over half of Japan Display's revenue, may soon take most of its orders elsewhere. Apple is likely to adopt the next-generation display technology called organic light-emitting diodes in at least one of its coming iPhones later this year. It may eventually even use OLED, which gives sharper images and uses less power, for all its iPhones from next year onward, says Goldman Sachs. Samsung currently owns almost the entire mobile OLED market, so it will likely be the sole supplier for the first OLED iPhone. Given that the display is the single most expensive component of an iPhone, Apple would be keen to secure another supplier, especially since Samsung is also its rival in smartphones. But even then, Japan Display is unlikely to be that second or even third supplier. LG Display, for example, said last month that it will sink another $7 billion into OLED, more than 60% of which will be on small-sized screens. Japan Display, which is still in dire financial shape, may struggle to compete. Longtime iPhone assembler Hon Hai also aspires to be an OLED maker through its Sharp unit. Japan Display was brought together under the government's watch in 2012 with the merger of display operations from Sony, Hitachi and Toshiba. After raising $3 billion in a 2014 IPO, it was meant to be Japan's screen-making national champion but has turned into a poster child for failed industrial policy. It is good to have a big customer like Apple, but it is better to have cutting-edge technology that the iPhone maker can't live without. '"
90,Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Houseparty has more than a million daily users. An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to them as monthly users. (Aug. 11) Tech startups live by the rule that speed is paramount. Houseparty, creator of a hot video app, has an extra reason for urgency. Facebook Inc., a dominant force in Silicon Valley, is stalking the company, part of the social network's aggressive mimicking of smaller rivals. Facebook is being aided by an internal ""early bird"" warning system that identifies potential threats, according to people familiar with the technology. This fall, Facebook plans to launch an app similar to Houseparty, internally called Bonfire, say people familiar with the project. Both apps let groups of people hang out over live video on a smartphone. ""They see we're having traction,"" says Sima Sistani, co-founder of Houseparty, which is based in San Francisco. ""That's why we're pushing so hard."" Silicon Valley is dominated by a few titans, a development that's fundamentally altering the nature of America's startup culture. While it's as easy as ever to start a company, it is getting harder to grow fast enough and big enough to avoid getting either acquired or squashed by one of the behemoths. For months, Houseparty could see Facebook in the rearview mirror. Last year, Facebook executives approached it for meetings the startup interpreted as exploring an acquisition. Then, two months after Houseparty publicly introduced itself as ""the internet's living room"" in November, Facebook's Messenger app said it would become a ""virtual living room."" Facebook in February launched a study of Houseparty, wooing its teenage users in a post that began: ""Hi everyone!! Do you use Houseparty?"" The deep pockets of giants such as Facebook, Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. make it increasingly difficult for startups to compete and stay independent. The four firms have a combined market capitalization of almost $2.5 trillion, a rough equivalent to the annual gross domestic product of France. Facebook acquired photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and messaging service WhatsApp in 2014 for $22 billion. Google in 2013 bought Waze, a rival to Google Maps. Amazon in 2010 bought Quidsi, the online retailing company behind diapers.com and other sites, after trying to copy it. Lately, the titans also appear to be imitating smaller rivals more aggressively. In July, a week after the initial public offering of Blue Apron Holdings Inc., an Amazon subsidiary filed to trademark a meal-delivery kit with a tagline that echoed Blue Apron's offering. Both Google and Facebook have taken aim at features on Snap. Inc.'s Snapchat platform. Amazon declined to comment. Google didn't respond to requests for comment. At an all-hands meeting last summer, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees they shouldn't let pride get in the way of serving users, another way of saying they shouldn't be afraid to copy rivals, according to someone who was at the meeting. The message became an informal internal slogan: ""Don't be too proud to copy."" Facebook executives have said publicly it is common in tech for companies to build on technologies pioneered by others. Regulators, politicians and academics are increasingly questioning how tech giants use their considerable clout. In June, the European Union's antitrust regulators fined Google $2.71 billion, saying its search engine favored its own comparison-shopping service over others. Google has said it disagrees with the conclusions and will consider an appeal. ""If you're an app, are you better off getting acquired or competing against one of the big platforms?"" says Scott Stern, management professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While getting acquired can be ""a very good win for the founders, that might be at the expense of a more competitive landscape."" Houseparty, formally known as Life on Air Inc., was one of the first startups to go all-in on video chat, with an app that lets small groups of friends drop into a video conversation as if hanging out in a dorm room. It has tapped a coveted audience: teens who love Snapchat but not necessarily Facebook. The odds are already stacked against it. The average smartphone user has about 89 apps on a device but uses only seven or eight daily, according to Verto Analytics. Facebook, Apple and Google dominate, commanding about 60% of the time and 80% of the ad dollars spent on mobile, the market-research firm says. Houseparty ""is one of the cool new apps??a good example of somebody who is challenging the status quo and may have success in a certain age group,""says Verto CEO Hannu Verkasalo. But Facebook, Google and Apple ""are extremely monopolistic,"" he says. ""It's very difficult to break in."" Two of Houseparty's founders??Ms. Sistani, 38, and Ben Rubin, 29??have been on the verge of success before. They previously led one of the first live-video-streaming apps, Meerkat, but its downloads tumbled after Twitter Inc. booted the app off its platform in favor of its own live-streaming app. Facebook delivered the death blow to Meerkat by deciding to go full force into live video. "" couldn't go head to head,"" recalls one of Meerkat's investors, Josh Elman, a former Facebook manager who is a partner at the venture-capital firm Greylock Partners and a Houseparty investor and board member. Later that summer, Mr. Rubin, Ms. Sistani and several others including the third co-founder, Itai Danino, sequestered themselves for several days to brainstorm. What users loved about Meerkat, they decided, was a feature that let them share the screen for 60 seconds with a friend. That type of video interaction was more private than the live video broadcasts on Meerkat, they concluded, and more spontaneous than a phone call. Their new app idea: ""We want to remind people how nice it is to catch up with your friends. Or how easy it is to say hi to your mom,"" says Mr. Rubin. ""It doesn't need to be this heavy thing."" In February 2016, Mr. Rubin and Ms. Sistani launched Houseparty and began to demo it on college campuses. In May 2016, it briefly became the top social-networking app for the iPhone, according to app-research firm Sensor Tower. Houseparty downloads went from 10,000 to 100,000 in one day and then crashed, unable to handle the load. The app was down for several hours and then glitchy through July, when the team decided it needed a major overhaul. When Houseparty was at its most vulnerable, Facebook came knocking. Fidji Simo, head of Facebook's video efforts, contacted Mr. Rubin, according to people familiar with the contact. She wanted to talk about live video, the people say. It was the first sign Facebook was scrutinizing Houseparty. Mr. Zuckerberg is sensitive to anything that might disrupt Facebook, even the teeniest startup, say current and former executives and employees. Facebook uses an internal database to track rivals, including young startups performing unusually well, people familiar with the system say. The database stems from Facebook's 2013 acquisition of a Tel Aviv-based startup, Onavo, which had built an app that secures users' privacy by routing their traffic through private servers. The app gives Facebook an unusually detailed look at what users collectively do on their phones, these people say. The tool shaped Facebook's decision to buy WhatsApp and informed its live-video strategy, they say. Facebook used Onavo to build its early-bird tool that tips it off to promising services and that helped Facebook home in on Houseparty. Houseparty says its growth had been stymied by the app's crash, which slowed its ability to introduce new features and attract new users. The calls from Facebook's Ms. Simo led to ""natural conversations,"" says Mr. Elman, the Houseparty investor and director, in which Facebook was exploring whether Houseparty would be a good fit for an acquisition. Mr. Rubin didn't want to sell but was under pressure from his board to keep Houseparty's options open, Mr. Elman says. ""If a company like Facebook or Snapchat needs your team's expertise, that might be a better return for shareholders than the risk of going big,"" Mr. Elman says he told Mr. Rubin. Mr. Rubin says in general he isn't against getting acquired as long as the opportunity would allow him ""to continue to work on the mission on a larger scale."" Mr. Rubin communicated with Ms. Simo and others over email and phone and then met with Facebook executives at Facebook's offices, says a person familiar with the contacts. Messrs. Rubin and Elman declined to discuss details of the conversations. Later, Ms. Simo informed Houseparty the talks wouldn't go further, the person says. Facebook said Ms. Simo declined to comment. In December, Facebook began its group-video-chat offensive. Its Messenger app introduced the feature with the ability to see up to six people in a conversation, compared with the eight-person rooms on Houseparty. In February, Facebook invited Houseparty users between the ages of 13 and 17 to come to its offices in Menlo Park, Calif., to participate in a study and keep a diary for a week afterward that they would share with Facebook, offering as an inducement $275 Amazon gift cards. Meanwhile, Houseparty readied for battle with $50 million in fresh funding in December from a group led by Sequoia Capital, a venture-capital firm that invested in WhatsApp and Instagram. Mike Vernal, a former Facebook executive, a Sequoia partner and Houseparty director, says Facebook's interest in Houseparty and live video chat is to be expected because ""Facebook has a mission that is fundamentally about helping people connect with each other."" He says he is optimistic about Houseparty's growth potential. Houseparty rebuilt its app so it could expand reliably without crashing. It added 25 employees, increasing its staff by 30%. Last month, it recruited a vice president of engineering, Kinshuk Mishra, who had helped Spotify AB, the music-streaming service, fend off Apple Music. It introduced a new chat feature called ""passing notes"" to attract more users. In Houseparty's office in an unmarked warehouse in San Francisco's trendy Soma neighborhood, the startup's leaders huddled in a tense meeting in May to discuss plans to beef up the app. When Ms. Sistani heard the company's lawyer had delayed some minor changes to the terms of service, the latest in a series of delays, she jumped in and said: ""No. No. No. No! Just update the policy."" The pressure increased later that month when Houseparty learned of Bonfire, Facebook's planned live group-chat app. (Tech news site The Verge reported on Bonfire in July.) ""I have no problem with the copying,"" Mr. Rubin says. ""It's just business. It's just a distraction."" Houseparty, which has one-million-plus daily users, compared with Facebook's 1.32 billion, is determined to beat Bonfire, he says. Mr. Elman says he is encouraged that Bonfire is a stand-alone app and that Facebook hasn't been particularly successful with those. But, he says, if Facebook figures out how to integrate the power of Houseparty ""into a property that I'm already using 10 times a day, that would scare the crap out of me."" ?~?~?'"
91,Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Apple Inc. took a public-opinion beating after it removed anticensorship tools from its China app store last weekend. ""Shame on Apple!"" was a sentiment voiced on social media by some who felt Apple was placing its commercial interests above their need to access information. Apple's response, as has been the case previously, is that it did so to meet China's regulatory requirements. Get used to hearing that a lot in the future. Apple has a China quandary. Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, is Apple's biggest foreign market, generating about 20% of the company's sales. China is also the mainstay of Apple's global manufacturing and supply chain. Increasingly, as it sells iPhones to Chinese consumers, it is selling them Apple services too. Apple's China App Store brought in more revenue than the U.S. store did last year. More Chinese are willing to pay for online services such as music, so there is hope for Apple Music. The company is promoting Apple Pay. That is where the risks kick in. Apple became the standout China success story among large U.S. technology companies partly because the Chinese government views it as a hardware company. Now it is obviously more than that. ""Apple's success globally had come from its close integration between hardware and software. Increasingly, that software means content,"" says Duncan Clark, a tech consultant and longtime China watcher. ""This has posed a challenge for the Chinese government."" That is also why, a former senior executive at a U.S. tech company told me, ""Apple's troubles have just started."" Apple says it has been vocal about its disagreements with governments. Chief Executive Tim Cook addressed the censorship matter Tuesday, telling analysts on an earnings call: ""We believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree."" Mr. Cook says Apple follows the law wherever it does business and that participating in markets brings benefits to customers and ""is in the best interests of the folks there."" He hoped for fewer restrictions in the future. Censorship is becoming increasingly stringent under President Xi Jinping. Boisterous online debate, much less dissent, is being quashed. Internet sites, even startups, have to hire phalanxes of staff to censor content that the government deems inappropriate. Apple shut down iBooks and iTunes Movies services in China last year. It removed the New York Times apps from the China App Store. Then last weekend Apple took down, according to mobile-app tracking site ASO100.com, over 400 apps with the description of ""virtual private network"" (VPN), or software that enables users to circumvent the country's vast system of internet filters. In all those cases, Apple said it was following Chinese laws and regulations. ""The government will continue to clamp down on anything that can possibly include politically sensitive material,"" says Tay Xiaohan, an analyst at IDC. ""I believe that Apple will continue to comply with the government's regulation for fear that the country would one day ban Apple's products."" Apple has been on a charm offensive. It has announced two new research-and-development centers in China, bringing its total commitment to R&D facilities there to $500 million. It recently appointed its first China head??a China-born, longtime Apple executive??and, according to a person familiar with the matter, she has been trying to recruit a government-relations executive. The thing is, instead of charm, some Chinese consumers want Apple to show some backbone??the way it did to the FBI when the company refused to unlock an iPhone used by an attacker in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings in 2015. ""Apple doesn't stand up and make some noise, which company can?"" asks Tao Jingzhou, a lawyer at Dechert LLP in Beijing. Apple has untapped leverage. It is the most valuable company in the world. The size of its market capitalization is multiples of the annual economic output of many countries. Appledirectly and indirectly accounts for lots of jobs in China??something the authoritarian Chinese leadership with its deep fe"" of social unrest cares about deeply. Other American tech companies are also submitting to Beijing's restrictive rules. The Chinese partner of Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud-computing business told customers this week to stop using VPNs to bypass China's internet gates, in order, Amazon says, to comply with regulations. Many Chinese Apple fans don't expect it to put up a big fight, much less exit the China market as Google's search engine did in 2010. Google''"
92,Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Apple Inc.'s new 10th Anniversary iPhone is still sight unseen, yet a glance at the company's latest quarterly results also raises the question of what else may be coming. Apple's spending on research and development totaled $2.9 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended July 1, rising 15% year-over-year against a revenue gain of just 7% for the same period. That brought Apple's R&D spending to $11.2 billion for the trailing 12 months, which is about 5% of the company's revenue for the period. Apple hasn't expended a greater portion of its revenue on R&D on an annual basis since 2004??three years before the first iPhone launched. That suggests other big things on the horizon, though what exactly is anyone's guess. Apple only claims ""n increase in headcount-related expenses to support expanded R&D activities"" in its quarterly filing. The company is widely reported to be working on projects related to self-driving cars, health-care monitoring and augmented reality, to name just a few. Apple, of course, is always loath to discuss any products it has in the works. But the company's pipeline is a salient question for investors who may rightfully be wondering what to do with the stock once this year's new iPhones see the light of day. Apple's market value has surged 35% this year to $820 billion??adding $45 billion since last week's earnings report, which all but confirmed that some new iPhones will indeed launch this quarter.

93,Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Apple Inc. is planning to introduce a smartwatch this year capable of connecting to cellular networks, according to people familiar with the matter, marking the first step in liberating the device and possibly consumers from their iPhone dependency. The new Apple Watch would have LTE capabilities similar to the data connection on a phone, which could allow it to access data, send and receive texts and make phone calls, the people said. Currently, the Apple Watch must be paired with an iPhone and use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to transmit data and texts. The cellular-enabled Apple Watch expected later this year would be available from all major U.S. carriers, the people said. It would likely be rolled into existing wireless plans for an additional monthly charge, similar to how data connections for tablets are sold today. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported the new watch on Friday. The new Apple Watch is part of Apple's plan to begin introducing a new smartwatch every other year, just as it does with the iPhone, one of the people familiar with the matter said. This fall would be the first iteration of the watch under the new release schedule. The first Apple Watch was released two years ago. Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams has been pushing for cellular connection on the Apple Watch since before its launch, the person said. However, its development has been challenged by issues related to the quality of cellular reception and other complications that come with such a small device. ""They're going to have to increase the battery significantly, and it's going to get bigger to provide more power,"" said Patrick Moorhead, a technology analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. ""It's a very hard thing to do because it's so small."" An LTE connection in the Apple Watch is good news for carriers, as the new connections could help pad subscriber counts and bring in new revenue. Carriers relied on tablets in past years to juice subscriber numbers, but many consumers canceled their tablet cellular connections after their contracts expired, resulting in customer losses. A data connection on an Apple Watch may prove more useful, however, and therefore less likely to result in cancellations. The new watch could help Apple regain its lead in the so-called wearables category. The iPhone maker shipped 2.8 million smartwatches world-wide in the second quarter but ceded top place to Xiaomi Corp., which shipped 3.7 million fitness trackers during the period, according to Strategy Analytics, a market-research firm. The Apple Watch has increased sales since it added a GPS chip last year that allows owners to track their runs, swims and other fitness activity without needing a phone. '"
94,Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'The Financial Times is launching a new mobile application for Apple iOS devices in the U.S. and the U.K., six years after it abandoned the platform following disagreements with Apple over revenue and data sharing. The company hopes its new app, available for iPhone and iPad, will help boost subscriber engagement with its content and in turn increase the revenue it is able to extract from its customers over the long term. ""We know that an engaged reader results in a larger lifetime value,"" said Cait O'Riordan, the FT's chief product and information officer. ""We want to know if a native app can help drive that engagement number."" Since 2011, Apple device users have only been able to access the FT's full range of content via its mobile website. The FT decided to invest in its web offering rather than a ""native"" iOS app partly because of Apple's requirement to be paid a 30% cut of any subscription revenue generated from apps in its App Store, according to people familiar with the matter. The new iOS app will therefore only be accessible to existing FT subscribers. New readers won't be able to purchase subscriptions from within the app itself, but must instead do so from the FT's website before logging in. This model means the FT can avoid giving Apple a cut of subscription revenue and will allow it to collect payment information and other valuable data directly from its subscribers. Spotify and other subscription-based services have taken a similar approach in recent years. Although it may not help convert new subscribers, the FT hopes a native iOS app will increase engagement among its existing subscribers owing to a variety of technical advantages. For example, native apps allow users to easily remain logged-in, provide a better experience with video, make sharing articles more seamless and allow readers to download some content to their devices to consume even when they don't have access to an internet connection. The new app might also be welcomed by consumers, who increasingly expect publishers' content to be accessible to them on whichever platform they choose. Mobile currently accounts for 55% of the FT's pageviews, the company said, but a search for ""financial times"" in Apple's app store previously returned apps for FT competitors including Bloomberg, the Economist and Barron's instead of the FT itself. Native apps can also offer some advantages for publishers when it comes to placing ads in front of readers. ""Our focus is subscriptions, but we do make money from advertising so we do care. We have put some effort into ensuring we have good ad viewability [in the app], and there are some ad formats that are easier to do in a native app,"" Ms. O'Riordan said. At launch, the iOS app is a relatively basic offering, but the company plans to invest more heavily in the product if it succeeds in driving reader engagement the way it hopes. ""We are data-driven. If the numbers show this is the right way to go then we will go in that direction,"" Ms. O'Riordan said. '"
96,Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'It is easy to forget that Apple Inc. makes things besides the iPhone. The company's fiscal third-quarter results Tuesday will be a salient -- if short-lived -- reminder of that. The iPhone still accounts for the lion's share of Apple's revenue and earnings. But the June quarter saw an unexpected year-over-year jump of 15% in iPad unit sales. That is the best growth Apple's pioneering tablet has logged in more than four years. And the company didn't have to buy those sales with discounts: The average selling price for the iPad stayed largely flat with the previous quarter. The iPad and stronger-than-expected services revenue helped Apple exceed Wall Street's estimates for the June quarter. That wasn't the only good news. Apple projected revenue in the range of $49 billion to $52 billion for the September quarter. The midpoint of that range represents a sales gain of 11% from the June quarter -- the strongest forecast for this period that Apple has made since it began launching its new iPhones in September five years ago. The forecast, in other words, suggests that at least some new iPhone models are coming in the September quarter and that Apple believes those models will sell. That is good news for investors who have driven Apple's share price up 30% this year -- not including the 6% additional bump the stock got Tuesday after the report. A stronger iPad and services business helps smooth out the iPhone cycle. And Apple clearly expects its new phones to make the connection. '"
97,Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'BEIJING -- Apple Inc. has been facing plenty of headwinds in China lately, including plunging sales, increasing competition from rival smartphone makers, and government pressure to comply with stiff new security rules. The new iPhone expected this fall offers a glimmer of hope, some analysts say, thanks to affluent Chinese consumers who are willing to pay premium prices for the latest technology. While China's overall smartphone market is flat, the higher-priced market, for phones that cost 4,000 yuan ($595) or more, is still increasing, analysts say. ""Consumers are still willing to upgrade and some of them are waiting to buy the next-generation iPhone,"" said Jin Di, a mobile-market analyst at research firm IDC. Factoring in the new iPhone, research firm Canalys forecasts shipments of 27 million iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches in mainland China for the last four months of 2017, compared with 22 million during the same period last year. Apple could use some good news from China: On Tuesday, it reported that sales sank 9.5% to $8 billion in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, for the third quarter ended July 1. That was the sixth consecutive quarterly sales decline in Greater China. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook offered a positive view, saying sales in Taiwan rose 20%. The rate of decline also eased from the previous quarter, when sales fell 14%. Along with shrinking sales in Greater China, Apple has also been grappling with new cybersecurity rules imposed by the Chinese government. Last month, Apple said it would open a data center in China that will be operated by a government-owned firm. Over the weekend, Apple removed virtual private network, or VPN, apps that allow Chinese users to skirt internet censors from its App Store in China to comply with new rules that require providers of such apps to obtain licenses from regulators. ""We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business,"" Mr. Cook said on a call with analysts, adding that Apple believes ""in engaging with governments even when we disagree. Industry consultants say Apple is taking care not to offend the Chinese government, especially as it prepares to launch the critical iPhone 10th anniversary model this fall. '"
98,Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'When Apple Inc. last year began breaking out revenue from app sales, music subscriptions and payment transactions, the accounting change seemed opportunistic. Sales of iPhones were declining and services provided a growing business to showcase. The change now appears more than justified. On Tuesday, Apple said services -- the App Store, iTunes, Apple Pay, iCloud and more -- generated more than $27.8 billion in revenue for the 12 months ended July 1, making it the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company and larger than Facebook Inc.'s total revenue in 2016. The company hit the Fortune 100 milestone a full quarter before predicted by Chief Executive Tim Cook, as rising subscriptions to Apple Music, Netflix Inc. and other services lifted services revenue 22% in the June quarter to $7.27 billion. The iPhone is still Apple's chief moneymaker, but services combined with better-than-expected iPad and Mac sales reduced Apple's total revenue from the iPhone to 55% in the quarter from 57% a year ago. ""The business is really impressive when you think about it in terms of scale compared to other publicly traded companies out there,"" said Jeff Dillon, chief executive of Jackson, Mich.-based Dillon & Associates, which counts Apple among its largest holdings. ""There's a long runway to go there."" Apple's total revenue rose 7.2% in the quarter to $45.41 billion, while profit was up 12% to $8.72 billion. The company's stock rose 5% in midday trading Wednesday. Apple boosted services revenue while facing a host of challenges, including discontinued movie sales in China, shrinking iTunes market share in the U.S., and a music-streaming service that is a distant No. 2 player in paid subscriptions to Spotify AB. The company remains guarded about which sources are driving services revenue. Apple annually reports total payments to app developers, and in June said Apple Music subscriptions hit 27 million. But it hasn't broken out revenue from AppleCare, Apple Pay, iTunes, iCloud storage or any of the other pieces that contribute to the business. The growth in services is driven by the size and quality of Apple's user base. Apple now has more than 1 billion devices in use world-wide. Its pricier iPhones, iPads and Macs are typically bought by more affluent consumers who load them up with apps or pay extra to store photos in the cloud. The App Store generates nearly twice the revenue of Alphabet Inc.'s Google Play, according to App Annie, a tracking service. Apple to some extent is drafting off broader consumer trends. An increasing number of customers are shifting from cable subscriptions to streaming-subscriptions services such as Netflix, HBO Now and Hulu, and many sign up through the App Store, giving Apple a 15% cut of the subscription. Apple said its number of subscriptions rose 12% in the past 90 days to 185 million. In a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri credited some of the growth to making App Store purchases easier by adding more payment options, such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Alipay in China. The services business hasn't been without headaches. In China, the government shut down Apple's movie and book sales because they violated local media guidelines. Apple also has faced criticism globally for removing apps in China such as the New York Times earlier this year, and others that allowed users to evade the country's censorship laws. Apple's streaming-music service continues to lag behind Spotify, which in June reported more than twice as many paid subscribers at 60 million. Movie rentals and sales on its iTunes service in the U.S. have been pressured by Comcast Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., reducing its market share to about 20% from more than 50% in 2012. The iPhone maker is trying to differentiate to gain Apple Music subscribers and video viewers by branching out into original content. It released the reality show ""Planet of the Apps"" in June and will add ""Carpool Karaoke"" next week. It recently hired two top Hollywood television executives to spearhead a push into original programming. ""We'll see how this area goes, but it's still an area of great interest,"" Mr. Cook said on the call. The services growth over the past decade is impressive considering late CEO Steve Jobs didn't want an app store. The iPhone launched without one, and Mr. Jobs primarily wanted to offer only Apple services, but employees and outsiders prevailed in getting him to change his mind, former employees said. '"
99,Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'The Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 22000 on Wednesday, reaching another milestone in the long bull market as investors bet that a resurgent global economy can offset lukewarm U.S. growth. The blue-chip index claimed its 32nd record of the year. Stocks continue to chug higher without a pullback of greater than 3% in more than a year, and volatility levels by some measures are hovering near all-time lows. The rally has been powered in large part by a revival in U.S. corporate earnings, which are on pace for another quarter of strong growth. The Dow Industrials rose 52.32 points, or 0.2%, to 22016.24, led by gains in shares of Apple Inc. after the company reported strong iPad and Mac sales in its most recent quarter late Tuesday. Overall, big companies with a sizable presence overseas, such as McDonald's Corp. and Boeing Co., have helped fuel the rally, and many investors are counting on a weak dollar to boost U.S. exports. Apple's gain??its biggest in six months??added roughly 49 points to the Dow Wednesday. Stocks must navigate a number of new challenges if the 8-year-old rally is to continue. The U.S. economic expansion is showing signs of stalling. President Donald Trump's proposed mix of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation was intended to revive the economy, but some of his agenda has""en stalled. Optimism about a pro-growth fiscal policy has waned. ""Economically things have been picking up nicely around the world, while the U.S. has turned out to be relatively disappointing,"" said Jimmy Chang, a senior portfolio manager and chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co. With domestic data looking lackluster, shares of multinational companies??which stand to benefit more than U.S.-focused companies from global growth??should fare well, he said. Paul Quinsee, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said the strong earnings season reflects ""re evidence of an upswing in the fortunes of the world economy."" ""Investors were expecting good earnings, and overall have not been disappointed,"" he said. A combination of low inflation and rising global growth could keep U.S. stocks climbing, despite a sluggish expansion in the U.S. and investors' dimming hopes for policy changes from the Trump administration to kick-start the economy. Investors and analysts in particular point to China as a sign that the global economy is on the mend, with a recovery in investment, manufacturing and trade. Europe also is perking up, with second-quarter data this week showing that the eurozone economy had gathered pace, a recovery that could encourage the European Central Bank to decide in the fall to scale back its bond-buying program. The International Monetary Fund most recently projected global gross domestic product growth at 3.5% for 2017, up from 3.4% last July. The IMF raised growth estimates for China, citing strong credit growth and fiscal support, and the euro area, highlighting diminishing political risks there. Meanwhile, the IMF lowered its forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2017 to 2.1% in July, compared with its projection of 2.5% a year ago. It cited skepticism the Trump administration would be able to push through business-friendly policies such as tax cuts. Even with global growth improving, inflation has remained persistently sluggish. That has contributed to weakness in the U.S. dollar, a boon for U.S. corporate earnings because it makes U.S. exports cheaper to foreign buyers. It also takes some pressure off the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, has fallen 7.5% since the start of the year, leading some firms to raise their year-end forecasts for U.S. stocks. At the end of July, investment bank Jefferies raised its estimate for where the S&P 500 would end the year to 2500 from 2325, citing weakness in the dollar, ""robust growth in overseas markets as global trade resynchronizes and the lack of policy tightening by China."" The S&P 500 rose 1.22 points, or less than 0.1%, to 2477.57 Wednesday. There are signs that U.S. companies whose businesses rely more on sales to customers overseas are already starting to benefit from these conditions. The S&P 500 industry groupings that get a higher share of their sales internationally than the benchmark are collectively up 13% in 2017 through Tuesday, topping the S&P 500's 11% rise over that period, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The groups with a higher share of domestic revenues than the S&P 500 were up 10% over that time. Among companies in the blue-chip Dow, shares of airline manufacturer Boeing Co., which recently got nearly three-fifths of its sales from outside the U.S., according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, are up 53% this year. That makes it the best-performing stock in the Dow industrials in 2017.Part of the reason behind Boeing's rally is a rise in global airline passenger traffic, which is boosting demand for new planes. Business has become ""more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe,"" said Dennis Muilenburg, the company's chief executive officer, on an earnings call last Wednesday. Other companies that serve as economic bellwethers have benefited from the global rebound. Caterpillar Inc., whose shares have risen 22% this year, reported last Tuesday that it may see its first year-over-year revenue increase since 2012, thanks to growing demand in China's construction sector and a stabilization in commodity prices. ""Mining and oil-related activities have come off recent lows and we're seeing improving demand for construction in most regions,"" said James Umpleby, Caterpillar's chief executive officer, on the firm's earnings call. And the S&P 500's technology sector has been the year's best performing group in the benchmark, rising 23% as investors seek out companies with growing sales and profit in a sluggish U.S. economy. Tech got 57% of its sales from outside the U.S. at the end of last year, more than any of the 11 S&P 500 sectors except energy, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The steady rise of passive investing, where investors own indexes that track broad markets, could be helping to spread gains beyond specific stocks and sectors, some analysts say. U.S.-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track indexes owned 13.9% of the S&P 500 at the end of March, up from 4.6% in 2005, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from Morningstar Inc. and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Still, many investors remain wary of the long U.S. stock rally. Auto sales, a heavyweight in the economic recovery, fell for a seventh consecutive month in July, and consumer debt loads have risen. A renewed slide in oil prices??especially if it is accompanied by fears of slowing global demand??could put pressure on global profits, similar to what happened at the start of 2016, analysts say. Any signs that central banks are moving toward raising rates f""er could also hit stocks, which have benefited from years of easy-m'"
100,Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'China's moves to tighten the screws on its already heavily gated internet stands to significantly raise the costs and level of difficulty for foreign companies doing business here. The government's recent crackdown on tools that allow internet users to circumvent the country's elaborate system of web filters could make it harder for companies to communicate with business partners, clients and suppliers overseas. The effort to block use of unapproved virtual private networks, or VPNs, and uncertainty over internet access is already weighing on foreign companies operations in China, according to foreign business groups. ""The success of our members is dependent upon instantaneous access to information on a world-wide basis as well as the ability to freely communicate with their affiliates, suppliers and customers around the world,"" said Lester Ross, chairman of the policy committee at the American Chamber of Commerce in China. ""We urge the government to take such concerns into account."" Many see the crackdown as a sign that China plans to be aggressive in enforcing a new cybersecurity law aimed at giving the government even more control over flows of information across the country's borders. ""This will affect the majority of foreign companies that operate in China,"" said Han Lai, China country manager for Washington DC-based legal technology consulting firm KrolLDiscovery. Forcing companies to send data offshore only through government-approved VPNs is a first step in implementing new rules that require businesses in ""critical industries"" to store broad categories of data inside China and get permission before moving it out of the country. The new rules could significantly increase costs for foreign companies by requiring them to set up new data centers in China or renting space from local cloud providers, analysts said. Firms will also have to set up specialized data-management systems for their China business and figure how, or whether, to integrate them with their existing operations. By using a VPN under the control of Chinese regulators, companies also make it easier for the government to track their activities and potentially steal their data, said Michael Hull, co-founder of Psiphon, an Ontario-based censorship circumvention company targeted in the crackdown. ""I can't think of a worse thing for a company to do than that. It's better not to use a VPN,"" Mr. Hull said. The closing of leaky windows on the Chinese internet began last month when censors disruptedFacebook Inc.'s popular messaging app WhatsApp, used by activists and others to send encrypted messages, and several foreign VPNs. More recently, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Beijing joined a list of companies that have taken steps to shut down access to unregistered or illegal VPN services. Apple's move to withdraw some VPN apps from China's iTunes store has already had its costs, said Graham Webster, senior research scholar at Yale Law School. Many foreign and Chinese businesses depend on the very commercial VPN products that Apple decided to remove from the iTunes store, other options could be less convenient and much more expensive, he said. All three companies said they took the steps to comply with China's new cybersecurity law. Many internet users have speculated the new restrictions are related to a Communist Party conclave this fall, when President Xi Jinping is expected to promote allies into top leadership positions while seeking re-election to a new five-year term. But industry insiders say the current assault on VPNs is broader and more intense than previous crackdowns associated with political events. Cybersecurity has been a central focus for China's leaders since U.S. government contractor Edward Snowden alleged in 2013 that the U.S. National Security Agency built back doors into technology gear to spy on other governments. In January, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology demanded that commercial VPN services available in China have approval from regulators. It also said dedicated lines to the global internet should only be used for companies' internal communications and are banned from connecting to data centers. An official with ministry said at a press briefing in late July that the VPN crackdown was aimed at illegal VPN providers and wouldn't affect enterprises' ""normal"" access to the global internet. The ministry didn't respond to multiple requests for further comment. Several VPN services registered in China have stopped or temporarily ceased services in the last month. Netfree Router, a Hong Kong-based service, sent an email to users on July 25 apologizing for a one-month service disruption as authorities checked their service for ""incorrect network usage."" The company declined to comment. Some foreign firms have gone without VPNs in the past, choosing to load sensitive data onto hard drives and shuttle it out by hand, according to Tom Groom, managing director of data-security consulting firm D4 Shanghai. ""I suspect we'll see the government crackdown on that practice as well,"" he said. '"
101,Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple Inc. managed to deliver the second-best revenue in company history for the June quarter, typically its weakest period, by re-energizing iPad and Mac sales and keeping purchases of iPhones steady as consumers anticipate a new phone this fall. The company's revenue jumped 7.2% from a year earlier, its best growth in seven quarters, as shipments of Apple's flagship product rose 1.6% to 41.03 million iPhones. The biggest surprise was a revival of the iPad business, and the continued momentum of the Mac, which both had waned in recent years as consumers shifted more money into smartphones. Mac sales rose 6.7%, the third consecutive quarter of gains, while iPads avoided a fourth consecutive quarterly slide with 1.9% growth. For the first time in 14 quarters, iPad shipments increased, rising 15% to 11.42 million units amid strong sales to schools and businesses.

102,Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Apple delivered the second-best revenue in company history for the June quarter. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it was the second-best revenue for the September quarter. (August 1) Apple Inc. delivered strong revenue in the June quarter, typically its weakest period, by re-energizing iPad and Mac sales and keeping purchases of iPhones steady as consumers anticipate a new phone this fall. The company's revenue jumped 7.2% from a year earlier, its best growth in seven quarters, as shipments of Apple's flagship product rose 1.6% to 41.03 million iPhones.

For the first time in 14 quarters iPad shipments increased, rising 15% to 11.42 million units amid strong sales to schools and businesses. Profit for the period rose 12% to $8.72 billion??the company's second consecutive quarterly increase in earnings after a yearlong downturn. ""e've got some momentum,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook said. ""A lot of things we've been working on a long time are beginning to show in the results."" The results came during what is historically Apple's softest quarter??a time when consumers often hold off buying iPhones in anticipation of an autumn release of a new device. Mr. Cook said discussions of future iPhones was greater than normal and affected sales, particularly of its highest priced devices, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. ""e believe there is a pause, but that probably bodes well for the future,"" he said. The iPad's resurgence and Mac's momentum helped bring balance to Apple results that had grown increasingly dependent on the iPhone in recent years. The iPad benefited from a recent refresh of the product line, including the introduction in March of an upgraded, basic iPad and in June a new, iPad Pro, Mr. Cook said. He said he expects the introduction of a new mobile operating system this fall, iOS 11, will strengthen sales as it introduces features such as file storage and drag-and-drop that are common on laptops. Mac sales increased despite a 4% contraction in PC sales world-wide, Mr. Cook said. Apple projected a wide revenue range of $49 billion to $52 billion for the current quarter, mostly eclipsing the analysts' consensus estimate of $49.2 billion in sales, according to Thomson Reuters. Had the company's estimates fallen short of analysts' expectations it would have indicated the company may be running into production problems with the next iPhone, said Brian White, an analyst with Drexel Hamilton. But the estimates suggest at least some of the product will be delivered on time in late September, rather than slipping entirely into the holiday quarter. Apple last gave a $3 billion range for its September quarter in 2014 when it released the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the first time it brought two phones to market. Sales of those devices were initially limited by supply constraints. The company is widely expected to release three phones instead of the usual two??updated versions of the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as well as a special 10th-anniversary iPhone with a different display and new features like wireless charging and facial recognition technology. The complexities of the new hardware led several analysts to predict for months that the iPhone would run into production challenges and supply constraints. Analysts have largely shrugged off that possibility, believing the iPhone will be delivered in time for Christmas and loyalists will wait for it to arrive in stores. ""n a way, that could be a marketing tool for them??a way to flame more excitement around the iPhone 8 because anything you can't get you want more,""Mr. White said. Appleshowed some improvement in Greater China. Sales there fell 9.5% to $8 billion in the quarter, marking the first time in five quarters the company hasn't reported a double-digit sales decline in the region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. The company has run into a host of challenges in China as many Chinese consumers hold on to their iPhones longer and others switch to lower-priced devices from rivals like Huawei Technologies Co. and BBK Electronics Corp. The market, which accounts for about 20% of total sales, is seen as critical to the success of the next iPhone. Mr. Cook said sales were flat in mainland China and rose 20% in Taiwan but fell in Hong Kong, where a strong currency has cut into tourism and shopping. Underscoring the market's importance, Apple recently named its first executive with oversight of its China business, Isabel Ge Mahe. She will manage government relations and help develop new operating-system features with local appeal, such as a function that allows iPhone owners to filter text-message scams common in China. ""One of the things we like about Apple is once you become an Apple customer you stay for the long haul, but that seems more difficult in China because there's more competition,"" said Jeff Dillon, chief executive of Dillon & Associates, a Jackson, Mich.-based investment firm and Apple investor with $300 million in assets. He said he was encouraged to see Apple ""stabilizing that business and starting to right the ship."" In addition to facing pressure in China, Apple has run into pressure in its local market where President Donald Trump renewed his push for the company to start manufacturing more products in the U.S. Mr. Trump last week said Mr. Cook promised to build three plants in the U.S., something the company hasn't done in more than a decade. Mr. Cook declined to comment on Mr. Trump's remarks. A White House aide referred requests for clarification on Mr. Trump's remarks to the company. In May, Apple announced a $1 billion investment fund for advanced manufacturing in the U.S. and injected $200 million of that into a Corning Inc. facility in Harrodsburg, Ky. ""There will be more??a lot more than three,""Mr. Cook said, speaking to future investments in U.S. manufacturing. ""There will be many."" Apple's cash reserves continued to swell during the quarter to $261.5 billion, compared with $237.6 billion at year-end. About 94% of that cash is held overseas, and investor hopes have been rising that the Trump administration's plan for a tax holiday would allow Apple to bring the cash home without paying steep taxes. Apple's services business??wh""h includes the App Store and its music and payment services??delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth, rising 22% to $7.27 billion. The business has become a major driver of the company's growth over the past year and a key part of its success in keeping more than 600 million iPhone customers world-wide. Analysts say iPhone users are less likely to ditch the device after loading it up with apps and using Apple Pay. Mr. Cook credited the rise in popularity of subscription services such as Apple Music, Netflix and HBO Now for propelling the App Store's growth. Subscriptions rose 12% in a 90-day period to more than 185 million subscribers world-wide. ""e reached the size of a Fortune 100 company before we thought we would,"" Mr. Cook said, noting that services revenue eclipsed $27.8 billion over the past four quarters. Apple's gross margin??a closely watched measure of profitability reflecting the percentage of revenue that remains after manufacturing costs??moved up to 38.5% from 38% a year ago. Analysts expected a margin of 38.2%, according to FactSet. For the current quarter, Apple projected a gross margin of 37.5% to 38%. Margins across the smartphone industry have been pressured by a surge in memory prices, which have risen more than 50% on the spot market over the past year, according to DRAMe'"
103,Fri Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Smart speakers powered by artificial intelligence are one of the hottest consumer products in the U.S. Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Apple Inc. are all offering competing products. If they think that is a crowded field, they should come to China. Within a day of Apple announcing its voice-activated HomePod speaker in June, Song Shaopeng, founder of smart-speaker technology startup Sugr Electronics Corp., fielded calls from three electronics manufacturers with the same request. All wanted his help to make HomePod-like products. Li Haibo, vice president of China's biggest online audio-sharing site Ximalaya, says that out of 300-plus speaker makers that license Ximalaya's audio content, more than 100 have switched to making smart speakers. In Shenzhen, China's tech hub, Mr. Li says he is approached by so many smart-speaker startups, all within a 20-minute walk from each other, that he often schedules a full day's meeting at the same coffee shop. China's big tech companies are also in the game. This month, e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and smartphone maker XiaomiCorp. each launched their smart-speaker models. Social-media behemoth Tencent Holdings Ltd. is working on something it is calling a ""smart box,"" according to a senior executive. Search engine Baidu Inc. unveiled an Amazon Alexa-like voice system that powers hardware. From tech giants to consumer-electronics makers, all see voice-activated products as the gateway to a future where platforms animated by artificial intelligence will power homes, cars and offices. To some, this first wave in the AI revolution already looks frothy. ""This is definitely a bubble,"" says Mr. Li of Ximalaya, which launched a smart speaker in June. China's online population is barely growing -- 2.9% last year by official data -- and the number of hours spent online hasn't budged in two years -- 3.8 hours a day. Internet companies need new ways to engage users, and smart speakers look like the next big thing. For the internet giants, voice command is seen as a critical technology, the new interface between humans and computers, after keyboards and touch screens. For ambitious startups, the smart speaker is an opportunity, like apps were at the advent of the mobile internet age. For electronics manufacturers, the smart speaker may keep production lines and sales humming, just as laptops, tablets, smartphones and drones did. An added inducement to jump in is that Amazon's, Google's and Apple's smart speakers don't offer voice interfaces in Chinese -- and those are hard to build. Smart speakers require complex software to recognize and execute voice commands and provide content ranging from weather forecasts, traffic reports, music, news and books, as well as services from shopping to payment. The speakers are supposed to interact with users and learn their preferences over time. That means heavy research and development. ""It's like when you were trying to build a smartphone in 2007 only to find that you had to build the Android operating system and the mobile apps running on the phone, too. It's not something for small startups,"" says Mr. Song, the Sugr founder. Ximalaya's owner, Shanghai Zendai Ximalaya Network Technology Co., joined with the new AI subsidiary of app developer Cheetah Mobile Inc., which hired more than 200 engineers to work on the smart speaker. ""It was a lot of work,"" says Mr. Li, the vice president. He says they used more than 80,000 different voices to ensure the speaker understands when people call its name, ""Xiaoya."" When they changed the cover fabric for the speaker, the voice recognition rate fell from 90% to 10%. They then spent a month rewriting the algorithm. Technology aside, the pack might be chasing a market that isn't yet there. Having only recently risen to the middle class, many Chinese have never lived with stereo speakers, much less a digital assistant, so they will need to get comfortable with both. E-commerce giant JD.com, which launched a smart speaker in 2015, sold 100,000 units last year and expects to sell hundreds of thousands this year. At prices between 179 yuan to 998 yuan ($27 to $148), the sales revenue is negligible for the company whose total revenue was 260.2 billion yuan in 2016. Since the launch three weeks ago, Alibaba's Tmall shoppers preordered roughly 7,600 AliGenie smart speakers at 499 yuan each ahead of the Aug. 10 shipping target. Ximalaya has an advantage, says Mr. Li, because the audio-sharing site's 370 million registered users and 22 million daily users are natural customers for a smart speaker. The company sold 50,000 units of Xiaoya at 699 yuan each the day it was launched and expects to sell one million units this year at 999 yuan each, including subscription services. '"
104,Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2017,0,"'Samsung last topped Apple's quarterly results in 2010. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Samsung's results position the company to top Apple in quarterly profits for the first time. (July 26) SEOUL_x0014_Samsung Electronics Co. delivered its biggest-ever quarter of profits, shrugging off a year of tumult by leaning on its dominance as a supplier of electronics components that even its rivals can't do without. Samsung said net profit jumped to 11.05 trillion South Korean won ($9.9 billion) for the three months ended June 30, an 89% rise from 5.85 trillion won for the same period a year earlier. Revenue shot up to 61 trillion won from April to June, rising from the prior year's second quarter of 50.94 trillion won. The South Korean technology giant blew past its previous record quarterly net profit of 8.24 trillion won, which came nearly four years ago as booming smartphone sales drove growth. In a shift from those days, components such as semiconductors and display panels, sold to competitors such as Apple Inc. or Sony Corp., account for about 70% of the firm's bottom line. Samsung's profits were also boosted by strong sales of the Galaxy S8, its first premium smartphone since last year's global recall of the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung said the Galaxy S8 and the larger S8+, which won strong reviews for their sleek design, have outsold its predecessor, the Galaxy S7, in almost all regions. Operating profits also rose 73% to 14.07 trillion, an all-time high, over the 8.14 trillion reported in the same period last year. The record-breaking results also position Samsung to top Apple in quarterly profits. Apple has a projected net income of $8.2 billion for the three-month period, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, in what is traditionally a weaker quarter for the world's most-valuable company. Apple, set to launch its 10th-anniversary iPhone, is still projected to notch up larger full-year profits than Samsung. Samsung Electronics shares are trading near all-time highs and have risen more than 60% over the past year. On Thursday, Samsung said it would continue a 9.3 trillion-won share buyback program this year, repurchasing 670,000 common shares and 168,000 preferred shares over the next three months. Samsung has so far repurchased about 5 trillion won worth of shares. Less than a year ago, Samsung's potential ascension to the world's most-profitable technology company, even for a singular quarter, would have seemed bold. Last fall, its Galaxy Note 7 devices overheated, and some caught fire, handing Samsung a crisis that ended with an embarrassing global recall that cost the company more than $5 billion. Then in February, Samsung's de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong, was put behind bars, accused of having a role in the country's corruption scandal. Mr. Lee denies wrongdoing and is standing trial. Even without its leader, its chic brand tarnished, the Suwon, South Korea-based firm saw its profits balloon due to voracious demand for its memory chips and flexible displays, mundane products that few consumers even realize are Samsung-made. More than a decade ago, Samsung began plowing billions of dollars into 3-D NAND semiconductors that can store more content in a small chip, allowing gadgets extra memory capacity. The company also moved aggressively into flexible OLED displays, short for organic light-emitting diodes, which enable phone makers to create sleeker, thinner devices. Despite the record quarter, the question hanging over the company's head is the fate of Mr. Le'"
105,Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'President Donald Trump on Tuesday said in an interview that Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook has committed to build three big manufacturing plants in the U.S., a surprising statement that would help fulfill his administration's economic goal of reviving American manufacturing. Mr. Trump, in a 45-minute interview with The Wall Street Journal, said Mr. Cook promised him Apple would build ""three big plants, beautiful plants."" Mr. Trump didn't elaborate on where those plants would be located or when they would be built. ""I spoke to [Mr. Cook], he's promised me three big plants??big, big, big,""Mr. Trump said as part of a discussion about business-tax reform and business investment. ""I said you know, Tim, unless you start building your plants in this country, I won't consider my administration an economic success. He called me, and he said they are going forward."" Apple declined to comment. Mr. Trump's comments were some of the first he has made regarding Apple manufacturing since assuming the presidency and revives pressure on the world's largest company by market value to move manufacturing operations from Asia to the U.S. Apple faced criticism from Mr. Trump last year on the campaign trail for outsourcing the production of its iPhones and other devices to factories in China. After Mr. Trump won the election, he said in Time magazine that he told Mr. Cook that he wanted ""Apple to build a great plant, your biggest and your best, even if it's only a foot bigger than some place in China."" Apple has said it supports about two million jobs in the U.S., including its own employees and those of suppliers, app developers and entrepreneurs who offer products across its devices. The company directly employs 80,000 people in the U.S. In May, Apple said it planned to create a $1 billion fund to invest in U.S. companies that do advanced manufacturing. It has committed $200 million from that fund to Corning Inc.'s glass-making facility in Harrodsburg, Ky. ""We're looking at this thing deeply,"" Mr. Cook said during an appearance on CNBC when he announced the new fund. ""How do we grow our employee base? How do we grow our investor base? How do we employ [in] manufacturing?"" A small share of Apple's products are made in the U.S. by contract manufacturers. Flex Ltd. makes Mac computers in Austin, Texas, and Quanta Computer Inc. produces Macs in Fremont, Calif. However, the overwhelming majority of Apple products are assembled in China, primarily by Foxconn Technology Group, which manufactures Apple's iPhone and other products. Mr. Trump also said Tuesday that Foxconn plans to build a big plant in the U.S. and is strongly considering putting it in Wisconsin. The Wall Street Journal reported this week the Taiwan-based company is nearing a decision to invest in a manufacturing facility that would produce display panels for television sets. It could hold an event in Washington, D.C., as soon as next week regarding those plans. In an emailed statement earlier this week, Foxconn said it was reviewing ""potential locations for establishing manufacturing facilities in the U.S."" but declined to name them. In Tuesday's interview, Mr. Trump said people in New York and other states without jobs will have to move to states like Wisconsin, Iowa and Colorado that are adding manufacturing. ""You're going to need people to work in these massive plants,"" Mr. Trump said. ""??I'm going to start explaining to people: When you have an area that just isn't working like upper New York state, where people are getting very badly hurt, and then you'll have another area 500 miles away where you can't get people, I'm going to explain, you can leave. It's OK. Don't worry about your house."" Building three manufacturing plants would be unprecedented for Apple as it only has one plant of its own currently in Cork, Ireland, where it has operated since 1980 and benefits from lower taxes on overseas profits. Apple instead primarily relies on contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, Pegatron Corp., Wistron Corp. and others to make iPhones, iPads and Macs. Under Mr. Cook, Apple has built one of the business world's most sophisticated supply chains, primarily in Asia where it sources parts ranging from chips to memory. The parts are sent to manufacturers in China which assemble more than 200 million iPhones annually. Apple's manufacturing prowess has helped the company achieve gross margins??a closely watched measure of profitability after manufacturing costs??of about 38% and helped it rake in more than 90% of the world's smartphone profits. Jason Dedrick, a professor focusing on the globalization of information technology at Syracuse University, said in December that forcing Apple to shift manufacturing to the U.S. could put it at a competitive disadvantage to rivals like Samsung Electronics Co. He estimated that assembling iPhones in the U.S. would add $30 to $""in production costs to each device. He would raise that total to $80 an iPhone if components like the processor, memory and display were also made in the U.S. Mr. Dedrick said that if Apple lost competitive ground to rivals, it could put some of Apple's high-paying U.S. jobs in marketing and engineering at risk. ""You have to ask: Do you want to put well-paid engineers out of work because you created policies to create assembly jobs?"" Mr. Dedrick said. Apple, which is expected to announce second-quarter earnings next week, stands to benefit as much as any U.S.'"
106,Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'Prominent technology-industry leaders and venture capitalists gathered in the White House's state dining room last month to discuss tech policy with President Donald Trump in an event that Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, helped organize. Seated at the rectangular table alongside the corporate luminaries, university presidents and senior White House officials was a less-prominent figure: Zachary Bookman, the 37-year-old CEO of a small startup called OpenGov. Mr. Kushner's brother, through a venture-capital firm, is a part owner of OpenGov, according to government disclosures and data from Dow Jones VentureSource. Until earlier this year, Mr. Kushner owned stakes in the venture-capital firm that he sold to his brother, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Kushner's connection to OpenGov isn't widely known. Many senior Trump administration officials hail from the business world, triggering concerns about potential conflicts between their private interests and public duties. The OpenGov situation??in which a top White House official helped organize a prestigious event where one of the participants was financially connected to his family??is an example of how such potential conflicts can play out. Scoring a seat at the summit was a milestone for OpenGov, a Redwood City, Calif. company that aims to make government data more user-friendly and has sought business with the federal government, according to its website. OpenGov's clients are mostly state and local governm""s??such as Converse County, Wyo. and California Polytechnic State University??looking to upgrade their technology. Mr. Kushner's connection to OpenGov is through Thrive Capital, a venture-capital firm run by his brother Joshua Kushner. Thrive is one of four investors that OpenGov lists on its website. A spokesman for Jared Kushner declined to comment. OpenGov's Mr. Bookman was the only chief executive of a small firm among the 18 tech leaders to get a seat at the table with the president. At least one other startup CEO had a second-row seat. OpenGov's valuation was estimated at $180 million after an October 2015 funding round, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, while the average market capitalization of the 14 publicly traded companies represented at the table??including Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.??is about $250 billion, according to FactSet. At the event, a video of which was made public, Mr. Trump thanked his son-in-law for assembling "" a spectacular group of people."" Mr. Bookman also praised Mr. Kushner for his work on tech issues. Mr. Trump said the meeting was focused on ways to use technology to make government more efficient. A spokesman for Thrive said the company ""did not play any role in OpenGov's invitation, and was not aware of its participation in the meeting until after the fact."" Mr. Kushner didn't suggest the invitation to OpenGov, according to Matt Lira, who works in his innovation office. ""It was my idea to invite OpenGov to our technology leadership listening session,"" Mr. Lira said in a statement. He added that he knew OpenGov from working with them in previous congressional roles. Mr. Bookman said he thinks his company was invited because it is ""recognized as an industry leader for our work at the state and local level."" He said the company is mainly focused on winning business from state and local governments, not Washington. Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said the OpenGov situation raised ethics issues. ""This seems like a textbook example of cronyism in action,"" she said. ""We always advised staff when arranging summits like this to avoid even the appearance of impropriety or preferential treatment,"" said Daniel Jacobson, who was counsel to the White House's information-technology and digital strategy offices in the Obama administration. He said he probably would have advised staff ""not to extend the invite or at least to invite other similarly situated companies."" The White House declined to comment. ""It's particularly interesting and remarkable, in that OpenGov does not have any federal customers and this is a federal initiative,"" said Kevin Merritt, founder of Socrata, a Seattle-based rival to OpenGov that works with the federal government and wasn't invited to the event. Thrive Capital invested in OpenGov in several fundraising rounds dating back to 2013. Jared Kushner was on Thrive's board at the time, and left in January. OpenGov represents a small part of Thrive's total investment portfolio, according a person familiar with the matter. The Thrive spokesman declined to say what the value of the investment was.

107,Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2017,1,"'BEIJING_x0014_To comply with tough new cybersecurity rules, Apple Inc. will begin storing all cloud data for its China customers with a government-owned company_x0014_a move that means relinquishing some control over its Chinese data. Apple will build its first Chinese data center in the southern province of Guizhou to house data for customers of its iCloud service. The data include photos, documents, messages, apps and videos uploaded by Apple users throughout the mainland, the company said Wednesday. The center will be operated by a company owned by the Guizhou provincial government, and whose chairman was a local government official until last year. Under the agreement, Apple will retain control over encryption keys at the data center. It wasn't clear if it would have access to any of the data itself, which would be overseen by its Guizhou partner. In addition, Apple wouldn't be able to transfer data from Chinese customers to the U.S., in compliance with China's new cross-border data guidelines that were also part of the latest cybersecurity rules. The announcement significantly expands a ""oncession Apple made to appease Chinese authorities in 2014, when it started storing some data at facilities owned by state-owned China Telecom to dispel security concerns. At the time, Apple said the move would improve performance for Chinese customers. Apple didn't clarify which data was being stored under that previous agreement, but under the new arrangement all of the iCloud data for its customers in China will be stored in the country. Currently, Apple pulls some iCloud data for Chinese users from servers in the U.S. Apple said it made the latest change to comply with China's new rules on data storage and cloud-services operation that went into effect June 1 as part of sweeping new regulations aimed at improving cybersecurity. It also said the new data center would improve speed and reliability for customers in China. The Silicon Valley company has been one of the technology industry's strongest advocates for fending off government incursions into user data. In a statement, Apple said it has ""strong data privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems."" The latest move comes as Apple has been facing increasing regulatory headwinds in China. Last year, for example, its online book and movie services was shut down by authorities, who didn't give specific reasons for the closing. China also has ramped up pressure broadly on foreign cloud-service providers over the past year to comply with longstanding rules that require them to partner with local firms. Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. already have local partners. ""It's clear that this is now being enforced across the board,"" said Chris DeAngelis, Beijing-based general manager of consultancy Alliance Development Group. ""Any cloud-based company coming into China has to have a local operating partner."" U.S. lawmakers sent a letter to China's ambassador in March, protesting the growing restrictions on foreign cloud-service providers. Under the arrangement announced Wednesday, Apple's China users will transition to a cloud-storage service that will carry the brands of both Apple and its Chinese partner, whose full name is Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data Industry Development Co. It is the first time iCloud has been co-branded. The transition will occur over the next several years while the $1 billion data project is developed. Apple has said its encryption can't be cracked, not even by Apple itself, making the company one of the strongest defenders of user privacy among major U.S. tech companies. Apple famously refused the FBI's demand that it unlock an iPhone owned by a gunman in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino. Governments world-wide regularly ask Apple for user data, which the company documents and publishes in an annual transparency report. In China last year, Apple said it had requests for more tha'"

In return, the businesses must stop accepting cash. The company unveiled the initiative on Wednesday as part of a broader effort to steer Americans away from using old-fashioned paper money. Visa says it is planning to give $10,000 apiece to up to 50 restaurants and food vendors to pay for their technology and marketing costs, as long as the businesses pledge to start what Visa executive Jack Forestell calls a ""journey to cashless."" ""We're really viewing this as the opening salvo,"" said Mr. Forestell, Visa's global head of merchant solutions, of the potential total $500,000 commitment. Consumers at those stores would be able to pay for goods or services only with debit or credit cards or with their cellphones. In exchange, Visa is offering to pay for upgrades to merchants' technology at the checkout line so that they can accept contactless payments, such as Apple Pay. The $10,000 incentive can also help cover some of the merchants' marketing expenses. Visa will pick the participating merchants from an application process that starts in August. Online-only shops are excluded. Visa has long considered cash one of its biggest competitors and has been taking steps to chip away at it. Getting rid of cash is a priority for Visa Chief Executive Al Kelly, who took over late last year, especially as cash and check transactions continue to grow globally. ""We're focused on putting cash out of business,"" Mr. Kelly said at Visa's investor day last month, adding that converting check and cash to digital and electronic payments is the company's ""number-one growth lever."" Visa processes credit and debit card payments on behalf of banks and merchants. The company makes money when consumers use their Visa-branded cards. An increase in transactions and payments volume over its network typically results in rising revenues. The company accounted for 59% of purchase volume on U.S. general purpose credit and debit cards last year, compared with rival Mastercard's 25% market share, according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication. Still, cash remains a formidable competitor. Check and cash transactions totaled $17 trillion world-wide in 2016, up about 2% from a year prior, according to Visa. Cards have made a dent in cash in the U.S., but cash remains the most widely used payment form among Americans, accounting for 32% of all consumer transactions in 2015, compared with 27% for debit cards and 21% for credit cards, according to a November report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Visa is trying to turn those numbers more in its favor. In the U.S., it is going after spending categories, such as parking and rent, that have been entrenched in cash and check payments for decades. Abroad, it is partnering with governments to move more payments onto its network, including an agreement that it recently signed with the Polish government to move the country to a cashless system. Some merchants have already stopped taking cash. New York City-based 2nd City, a Filipino taqueria, hasn't accepted cash since it opened its doors in 2016. Michael Ryan, the co-owner and co-founder, said he never ordered cash drawers or a safe. By not having to count cash, visit a bank or order change, Mr. Ryan estimates, the manager on duty saves about 23 hours a week. The restaurant, which mostly caters to millennials, has had ""very little"" push back from customers, Mr. Ryan said. He added that the downside is the fees that his business pays to the card issuers. Indeed, many merchants prefer cash because they don't have to share the revenue with card companies. Credit-card interchange fees, which networks like Visa set and that merchants pay to the banks that issue their cards, are on average around 2% of the transaction amount, according to the National Retail Federation, the largest trade group that represents merchants in the U.S. ""The idea that merchants don't want to accept cash is a myth,"" said Mallory Duncan, senior vice president and general counsel at the National Retail Federation. Visa says merchants making the move stand to benefit from higher sales and lower theft risk. Some, though, are skeptical that Visa can take the cashless push much further.
